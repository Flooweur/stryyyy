# Chapter 9: Crossing Lines

## Chapter Summary
Simera crosses into more dangerous/extreme content. She breaks her promises to Liz and to herself. The rationalization: just once, for the money, it's not that bad, others do worse. She creates a Memento that crosses a moral line—maybe violent, maybe sexually degrading, maybe involving drugs or crime. The experience itself. The payment that follows—significantly higher. The moral weight versus the economic reward. The justification that it's just content, no one's really hurt, it's a job. Liz's discovery and confrontation. Damage to their relationship.

## Key Story Beats
- [ ] Market pressure or opportunity for extreme content
- [ ] Simera's internal deliberation
- [ ] Decision to cross boundaries she'd set
- [ ] Preparation for the extreme recording
- [ ] The experience itself (visceral, dark)
- [ ] The aftermath and large payment
- [ ] Simera's rationalizations
- [ ] Liz discovering what Simera did
- [ ] Confrontation between them
- [ ] Damage to trust and relationship

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Rationalization, moral compromise, hardening
- **Liz**: Betrayal, concern, anger, fear for Simera

## Themes to Explore
- Moral erosion
- How we rationalize violations of our own values
- Economic coercion
- The cost of survival
- Betrayal of self and others

## Atmosphere & Tone
Dark, tense, morally complex. The sense of falling (echoing Chapter 1). No easy answers. Tragedy of circumstance meeting choice.

## Writing Notes
- Make the extreme content disturbing but not gratuitous
- Simera's rationalizations should feel human and understandable
- Liz's reaction should be complex - not just anger but fear and grief
- The confrontation should damage both of them
- Show the seduction of the money alongside the moral cost
