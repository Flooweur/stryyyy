# Chapter 10: Black Market

## Chapter Summary
Simera discovers or is approached about the black market for illegal Mementos. Content that Heri won't accept: murder simulations, extreme violence, snuff elements, hardcore drugs. The payments are astronomical. The danger is real. She learns about creators who use dissociatives before recording to make the experience feel more genuine (since consumers can feel if the creator knows they're recording). The underworld of Memento creation. Temptation despite—or because of—the danger. The machinery of exploitation revealed. Simera standing at another threshold.

Sinister, seductive danger. The underworld revealed. A sense of descending deeper into darkness. Grim inevitability.

## Writing Notes
