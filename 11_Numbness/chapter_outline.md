# Chapter 11: Numbness

## Chapter Summary
Simera deep in creation now. Routine has set in. She creates regularly, increasingly extreme content. Life is materially better but emotionally hollow. Her OCD perhaps worsening or manifesting differently. She consumes Mementos (her preferred type - Asian women, sexual, falling) but feels nothing. Everything is muted. The mundane moments of life pass unnoticed. Liz tries to reach her through small gestures, absurdist observations, attempts at connection. Simera is physically present but absent. The growing nihilism in Simera's worldview shown through choices and reactions, not exposition.

## Key Story Beats

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Numb, detached, going through motions, increasingly nihilistic
- **Liz**: Fighting to maintain connection, showing absurdist philosophy in face of this, her own pain

## Themes to Explore
- Emotional death while physically alive
- The cost of commodifying experience
- How we lose ourselves gradually
- The inadequacy of material success
- Love confronting absence

## Atmosphere & Tone
Gray, muted, hollow. The horror of emotional death. Quiet devastation. Slow suffocation.

## Writing Notes
- Show numbness through absence of sensation/detail
- Contrast with earlier chapters where Simera noticed everything
- Liz's absurdism vs. Simera's nihilism - show not tell
- Make the emptiness palpable
- This should hurt in a different way - quiet grief
