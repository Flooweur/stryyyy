# Chapter 16: The Disconnect

## Chapter Summary
Simera in real life but feeling like it's a Memento. She doesn't recognize where she is—but it's her own apartment. She doesn't recognize the moment she's in—but it's her own life. The inversion of Chapter 13: then she confused Mementos for reality; now she confuses reality for a Memento. The complete disconnection from her life. Looking at Liz like a stranger. The apartment unfamiliar. Her own body foreign. Everything experienced as if it's simulated. The horror of being unable to recognize your own reality. Waiting for it to end, to "wake up."

## Key Story Beats

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Completely dissociated, absent from herself and her life
- **Liz**: Devastated, seeing Simera not recognize her, their life, anything

## Themes to Explore
- Complete loss of self
- Dissociation as existential horror
- The self as a construct that can dissolve
- Love unable to reach across the void
- The final alienation

## Atmosphere & Tone
Surreal, tragic, existentially terrifying. The complete untethering. Love confronting complete absence. The ultimate horror—not death but this.

## Writing Notes
- Make the disconnection total and palpable
- Simera looking at her life from outside
- Liz's devastation at not being recognized
- The tragedy of Simera waiting for her "real" life to start
- This should break the reader's heart completely
- The horror is quiet but absolute
