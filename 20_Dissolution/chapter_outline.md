# Chapter 20: Dissolution

## Chapter Summary
The ending. The consequence of Simera's choice in Chapter 19. This could take many forms depending on where you've led the story: Simera's complete dissolution of self, an attempt at reconnection with Liz, a final recording, a moment of grace or a moment of ultimate loss, an ambiguous ending that mirrors the opening fall, or something else entirely. Whatever it is, it should be emotionally devastating, thematically coherent, and earned by everything before. It should make the reader feel intensely—dread, sorrow, catharsis. The ending should resonate with the opening chapter's fall, bringing the story full circle in some way.

## Themes to Explore
- The final cost
- What dissolution means
- Whether anything can be salvaged
- The nature of self and loss
- The meaning of the journey
- Resonance with opening themes

## Atmosphere & Tone
Depends on the ending you choose, but it must be: emotionally devastating, thematically coherent, earned, resonant with the whole story. It should echo the opening's fall. It should make readers FEEL. It should hurt in a meaningful way.

## Writing Notes
- Don't rush the ending
- Let it breathe and resonate
- Echo the opening (the fall) in some way
- Make it hurt but make it mean something
- Prize-worthy endings are earned through everything before
- The reader should feel the full weight
- Consider ambiguity if it serves the themes
- Whatever happens, make it devastating and true
- This is where you make them cry
