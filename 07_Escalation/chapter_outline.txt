CHAPTER 7: ESCALATION
======================

CHAPTER PITCH:
Over the next three months, Simera falls six more times—each from greater heights, each generating higher intensity ratings, each depositing money into her account that evaporates as quickly as it arrives—and between the recordings she consumes Mementos with increasing frequency, sometimes unable to remember if she's just experienced someone else's death or her own near-death, while Liz watches her girlfriend's body accumulate scars and bruises that never fully heal, her personality flattening into something that only animates when discussing her next fall, and when Simera casually mentions that Kael asked if she'd consider recording without safety equipment for triple the payout, Liz realizes with horror that this is no longer about money but about Simera's methodical erasure of herself.

EXHAUSTIVE INSTRUCTIONS & IDEAS:

STRUCTURAL FUNCTION (Save the Cat! Beat Sheet):
- This is B STORY deepening + FUN AND GAMES continuation
- Montage of escalation (time compression)
- Show pattern: fall, money, spend, fall again
- Relationship deterioration
- Physical toll mounting
- Introduction of no-safety-equipment option
- Midpoint approaching (point of no return)

STRUCTURE:
- Montage format showing multiple falls
- Interspersed with relationship scenes
- Time markers: Week 2, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12
- Each fall briefly described (not full scenes)
- Focus on cumulative effect rather than individual experiences
- Progressive degradation visible

MONTAGE OF FALLS:
FALL #2 (Week 2): 40 stories, airbag, 8,200 units, intensity 8.4
FALL #3 (Week 4): 45 stories, airbag, 9,100 units, intensity 8.6
FALL #4 (Week 6): 50 stories, airbag, 10,500 units, intensity 8.9
FALL #5 (Week 8): 52 stories, different building, 11,000 units, intensity 8.7
FALL #6 (Week 10): 55 stories, night fall, 12,300 units, intensity 9.1
FALL #7 (Week 12): 58 stories, storm conditions, 13,800 units, intensity 9.3

PATTERN SHOWN:
- Heights increasing
- Ratings plateauing (body adapting)
- Need to add variables (night, weather) to maintain intensity
- Money increasing but never enough
- Time between falls decreasing
- Recovery periods shrinking

PHYSICAL DETERIORATION:
- Chronic bruising (body never fully heals)
- Weight loss (not eating properly)
- Sleep disruption (nightmares of falling)
- Persistent tremor in hands
- Hypervigilance (always on edge)
- Pain normalized (becomes background noise)

SIMERA'S TRANSFORMATION:
- Personality flattening when not falling
- Obsessive about next recording
- Tracking her own intensity ratings
- Studying other creators' work
- Competitive about being "best"
- Disconnected from everything else
- Only animated when discussing falls

LIZ'S DETERIORATION:
- Stopped trying to convince Simera to quit
- Watching helplessly
- Her own scams failing (distracted)
- Drinking more (new detail)
- Reading Camus obsessively
- Sleeping separately (couch or chair)
- The apartment no longer home

RELATIONSHIP SCENES:
1. After Fall #3: Liz treating Simera's bruises, silence between them
2. After Fall #5: Argument about money (still poor despite earnings)
3. After Fall #6: Liz asking "Do you even love me anymore?" Simera: "I don't know."
4. After Fall #7: The safety equipment conversation

THE SAFETY EQUIPMENT CONVERSATION:
- Simera home from Fall #7, exhilarated
- "Kael says I'm one of their best."
- "They want to offer me premium opportunities."
- Liz: "What does that mean?"
- "No safety equipment. Real free fall. Net at bottom instead of airbag."
- "That's insane."
- "It pays triple. 40,000 units for a sixty-story fall."
- "You could die."
- "The net will catch me."
- "What if it doesn't?"
- "Then Heri gets a Finale and my estate gets 100,000 units."
- "Your estate. You mean me. You're talking about your death like it's a bonus."
- "Isn't it?"

MONEY DETAILS:
- Total earned over 12 weeks: ~71,000 units
- Should be life-changing
- Where does it go?
  - Rent (paid ahead but not saved)
  - Food (better but not extravagant)
  - Mementos (HUGE expense, 30,000+ units)
  - Medical (treating injuries, 8,000 units)
  - Debts (paying off old obligations, 15,000 units)
  - Liz's expenses (she stopped scamming, 10,000 units)
  - Misc (clothes, repairs, etc., 8,000 units)
- Never accumulating savings
- Always need more
- The treadmill of earning

MEMENTO CONSUMPTION ESCALATION:
- Simera now using multiple Mementos per week
- More expensive ones (death-adjacent)
- Falls, but also: violence, drugs, extreme pain
- Blurring her own experiences
- Sometimes can't remember which fall was hers
- Liz finding her unconscious, connector still attached
- The addiction feeding addiction

OTHER CREATORS:
- Simera meeting them at recordings
- Brief camaraderie
- Sharing techniques for higher ratings
- Talk about "the rush"
- Veteran creator dies (Fall #5 timeframe)
  - News reaches Simera
  - Woman, 10th recording, net failed
  - Heri paid estate, business as usual
  - Simera feels nothing
  - That night, she uses a death Memento

KAEL'S INCREASING INTEREST:
- Regular check-ins
- "You're special, Simera. Natural talent."
- Offering premium opportunities
- Suggesting no-safety falls
- Mentioning other extreme experiences
- Always professional, always calculating
- He sees her potential (profit potential)

THEMATIC ELEMENTS:
- Addiction's acceleration (tolerance building)
- Work as self-destruction normalized
- Money insufficient to fill void
- Love powerless against obsession
- The body as commodity, used until used up
- Escalation as inevitable (market demands it)
- The difference between living and being alive

WORLD-BUILDING:
- Creator culture (community of self-destructors)
- The industry's normalization of death
- Premium tier opportunities
- Estate payments for Finale Mementos
- Insurance and liability structures
- The market's appetite for escalation

FORESHADOWING:
- The dead creator (Simera's future?)
- No-safety-equipment option (next step)
- Kael's mention of "other experiences" (black market)
- Simera's flattening affect (losing herself)
- Liz's drinking (her own dissolution)
- "Then I'll die" said casually (death wish crystallizing)

PHILOSOPHICAL CONTENT:
- Liz's absurdism failing her
- Can't embrace meaninglessness when watching loved one die
- Camus: "There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide"
- Liz confronting this directly
- Simera already answering it
- Not suicide exactly, but adjacent

EMOTIONAL BEATS:
- Excitement (Simera's ratings, success)
- Numbness (between falls)
- Exhaustion (Liz's helplessness)
- Anger (Liz's frustration)
- Emptiness (Simera's baseline)
- Brief animation (discussing next fall)
- Horror (Liz hearing about no-safety option)
- Acceptance? (Simera ready to die)

KEY IMAGES:
- Simera's body as map of bruises
- Money flowing in and out (visualized somehow)
- Liz sleeping in chair (no longer sharing bed)
- The cracked mirror showing Simera's thinning face
- Kael's satisfied expressions (she's profitable)
- The veteran creator's memorial (if any)
- The spider's web overloaded, breaking

PACING:
- Use montage technique (compress time)
- Rhythm: fall, aftermath, money, consumption, repeat
- Accelerating pace (falls coming faster)
- Slow down for key relationship moments
- End with the safety equipment conversation (full scene)

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- 10-12 pages
- Use time stamps clearly
- Brief fall descriptions (impressionistic)
- Focus on cumulative effect
- White space showing gaps/time passing
- Dialogue showing deterioration

AVOID:
- Making falls repetitive (vary each one)
- Losing emotional stakes
- Making Liz unsympathetic
- Explaining too much (show pattern)
- Forgetting physical consequences
- Rushing to midpoint

CLOSING IMAGE:
- Simera at window, looking at her reflection
- Barely recognizes herself
- Bruised, thin, tremoring
- "I told Kael yes. Next week. No safety equipment."
- Liz crying, silent, turned away
- The gap between them now measured in miles
- The money in the account: 3,200 units
- Despite everything, still poor
- Still falling
- Will keep falling

FINAL NOTE:
This chapter shows the addiction's full grip. Simera is no longer falling to survive—she's surviving to fall. The money is excuse, not reason. She's found purpose in self-destruction and will pursue it to the end. End with the commitment to no-safety-equipment fall, the point where survival becomes genuinely uncertain. The question is no longer "Will she stop?" but "Will she survive?"
