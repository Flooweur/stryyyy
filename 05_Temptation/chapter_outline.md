# Chapter 5: Temptation

## Chapter Summary
Simera makes the decision to try creating. The process of acquiring recording equipment (maybe she borrows, rents, or buys cheap). She researches what to do for her first recording—something relatively safe but marketable. The planning stage. Her nervousness and excitement. Liz's mixed feelings—she understands why but worries about what it means. A conversation about boundaries, about how far Simera will go. Simera's promises (that will later be broken). The anticipation of crossing this line.

## Key Story Beats
- [ ] The decision is made - Simera commits to creating
- [ ] Acquiring recording equipment/device
- [ ] Research into "entry-level" creation
- [ ] Planning her first recording
- [ ] Conversation with Liz - boundaries, concerns, support
- [ ] Simera's promises about limits
- [ ] Preparation, nervousness, excitement
- [ ] The night before her first recording

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Rationalizing, excited, nervous, determined
- **Liz**: Worried but supportive, establishing boundaries, expressing love and concern

## Themes to Explore
- The first compromise
- How we rationalize crossing our own boundaries
- Support vs. enabling
- The seduction of "just this once" or "just a little"
- Economic necessity as justification

## Atmosphere & Tone
Tense anticipation. The calm before the storm. Intimate conversations that will later feel tragic. The last moment before everything changes. Both exciting and ominous.

## Writing Notes
- Make Simera's reasoning feel genuine and relatable
- Liz's support should be loving but tinged with foreboding
- Establish boundaries that will later be broken
- The equipment as a physical commitment
- Build tension toward the next chapter
