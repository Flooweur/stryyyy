# Chapter 5: Temptation

The recording equipment arrives on Tuesday in a box smaller than Simera expected.

She counts: fourteen centimeters wide, twenty-three long, eight deep. The dimensions of a future, of a transformation, of a door opening into something she can't yet see clearly but knows she has to enter because all the other doors have closed, have locked, have disappeared behind her like they were never there at all. The box is brown cardboard, unmarked except for a shipping label and a barcode that looks like a tiny prison of lines, black and white and absolute in its encoding of what this is: merchandise, product, the tool that will turn her into merchandise, into product, into something that can be bought and sold and consumed and discarded.

She signed for it at the door. The delivery driver didn't look at her—they never do, delivery drivers in poor neighborhoods, they've learned not to see people, not to acknowledge the poverty they're delivering to, the desperation they're enabling. He just thrust a scanner at her, waited for her signature, handed her the box, left. Twelve seconds total. She counted. Twelve seconds for her life to change material form, to become something physical she's holding, something she can't pretend isn't real anymore, isn't happening, isn't the choice she's made.

The box sits on the table-door between her and Liz. Neither of them has opened it yet. They're just looking at it the way you look at something dangerous, something that might explode, something that will definitely change everything once you engage with it and can't be unchanged, can't be taken back, can't be unmade.

"How much did it cost?" Liz asks. Her voice is careful, neutral, the voice she uses when she's trying not to judge, when she's fighting against her own feelings to stay supportive, to be present, to not make this harder than it already is.

"Two hundred and forty dollars," Simera says. "I used the credit card."

"The one that's maxed out?"

"It wasn't maxed out. It is now."

Liz nods slowly. Her hands are wrapped around a mug of coffee that's gone cold—Simera knows because it's been sitting there for forty-seven minutes, she's been counting, the mug hasn't moved except for three times when Liz picked it up to drink and then set it back down without drinking, just holding it, just needing something to hold onto. The coffee was never actually hot to begin with. Their hot plate doesn't get hot enough for real hot coffee. Just warm coffee that pretends to be hot for about six minutes before giving up, before surrendering to room temperature, before becoming another thing in their apartment that's not what it should be, not what it promises to be, just another disappointment disguised as function.

"You want me to open it?" Simera asks.

"Do you want to open it?"

"I don't know."

"That's honest."

The apartment is quiet except for the usual sounds—the building groaning, the pipes rattling, the neighbors upstairs walking back and forth, back and forth, nine paces each direction, she's counted, they walk the same pattern every day like they're pacing, like they're trapped, like everyone in this building is trapped in their own rhythm of desperation and they just keep walking it, keep performing it, keep existing in the same loops because loops are all poverty gives you, the same patterns repeated until you die or escape or become something else entirely.

Outside the window, the alley is gray. It's always gray. Even on sunny days—which are rare, which Simera counts obsessively: seventeen sunny days in the last ninety-three—the alley manages to be gray, manages to transform light into shadow, manages to make even sunshine feel like failure. Today isn't sunny. Today is overcast, which matches. Today is gray on gray on gray, which is perfect, which is appropriate, which is the exact color a day should be when you're about to open a box that contains the equipment you'll use to record yourself for strangers to consume, to turn your experiences into products, to become what you've been consuming, to cross from one side of exploitation to the other.

Simera reaches for the box. Her hand is shaking. Just slightly. A tremor so small that maybe Liz can't see it, maybe Liz is pretending not to see it, maybe they're both pretending a lot of things right now because pretending is easier than acknowledging, than naming, than saying out loud what this is, what this means, what this makes her.

The tape is already partially torn—the delivery driver probably opened it to check the contents, to verify, to make sure she wasn't ordering something illegal, something dangerous, something other than the equipment you use to commodify yourself. She peels it back the rest of the way. The sound is loud in the quiet apartment: the screech of adhesive separating from cardboard, the protest of materials being torn, being violated, being opened to reveal what they contain.

Inside: bubble wrap. An invoice. An instruction manual. And underneath, nested in protective foam like something precious, like something that should be handled with care even though what it will be used for is the opposite of care, is the deliberate removal of care, is the calculated decision to stop caring about what happens to you as long as it sells, as long as it pays, as long as it solves the problem of poverty even if it creates other problems you can't yet see, can't yet count, can't yet prepare for.

She pulls out the device.

It's smaller than the one she uses to consume Mementos. That one is sleek, consumer-grade, designed to look appealing, to look like something you'd want to own, to use, to plug into your skull and let it rewrite your consciousness. This one is utilitarian. Black matte plastic. No curves, just angles. Function over form. A rectangle with a port on one end, a button on the other, a small screen on the side displaying battery percentage: 73%. A cable coiled beside it, medical-grade, the kind they use in hospitals, the kind designed to interface with the jack behind her ear, to connect directly to her nervous system, to her brain, to the part of her that makes her who she is so it can record that, capture it, turn it into data that other people can download and experience and consume.

"It's smaller than I thought," Liz says quietly.

"Yeah."

"You'd think something that records your whole consciousness would be bigger."

"Technology gets smaller. That's the whole trend. Everything getting smaller, more efficient, more invasive, fitting more control into less space." Simera turns it over in her hands. The weight is significant—heavier than it looks, dense in a way that suggests quality, suggests durability, suggests this was made to last, to be used repeatedly, to be the tool you use over and over as you record yourself, as you sell yourself, as you transform yourself from person to product piece by piece by piece.

The instruction manual is thin. Twenty-three pages. She counts them. The language is simple, direct, designed for people who don't need complexity, who just need to know: plug this in here, press this button, start recording, stop recording, upload to the app, collect your money. Six steps. Six steps to turn your life into income. Six steps to cross the line between consumer and creator. Six steps that look easy on paper but feel impossible sitting here in this gray apartment with Liz watching her with eyes that are worried and supportive and scared and trying so hard not to be scared because being scared would make this harder, would make Simera doubt, would introduce questions that can't be answered because the math only works one way, because there are no other options, because this is what survival looks like when all the other methods of survival have failed.

"Says here I need to calibrate it first," Simera reads. "Connect to my neural port, let it map my consciousness patterns, establish baseline readings. Takes about twenty minutes."

"And then what?"

"And then it's ready. And then I can record whenever."

"Whenever," Liz repeats. The word sounds heavy in her mouth, like it weighs more than it should, like it contains more meaning than its syllables suggest. "Whenever you decide to sell a piece of yourself. Whenever you decide to turn your experiences into products. Whenever you're desperate enough or brave enough or broken enough to—" She stops. Closes her eyes. "Sorry. That's not helpful."

"It's honest."

"Honest isn't always helpful."

Simera sets the device down on the table-door. Between them. An object that represents everything—the decision, the desperation, the future, the transformation, the ending of one version of herself and the beginning of another version that she doesn't know yet, can't know yet, won't know until she's already become it and it's too late to change back, too late to choose differently, too late to be the person she is right now in this moment before she's started recording, before she's started selling, before she's crossed the line that you can't uncross.

"I've been doing research," Simera says. "About what to record first. What sells. What's safe to start with."

Liz opens her eyes. "Safe. That's a word."

"Relatively safe."

"Relative to what? Jumping off buildings? Recording yourself fucking strangers? Doing illegal shit for the black market?"

The words are harsh but the voice isn't. The voice is gentle, concerned, the voice of someone who loves you and is watching you make choices they can't stop, choices they understand the necessity of but hate the existence of, choices that wouldn't have to be made in a different world, a different system, a different version of reality where people aren't forced to commodify themselves to survive, where poverty doesn't require self-destruction as the price of escape.

"Relative to that, yeah," Simera says. "I'm thinking... just a walking tour first. Something simple. The city at night. Show the streets, the buildings, the lights. Give people a sense of place. There's a market for that—urban exploration, atmospheric content. It's not high-paying but it's safe. It's just walking. Just existing. Just being present in a place and letting other people experience that presence."

"That doesn't sound so bad."

"It's not. That's the point. Start small. Build an audience. Get comfortable with the technology, with the process, with the fact of being recorded, of performing my life instead of just living it. Then—" She stops.

"Then what?"

"Then I can do other things. More profitable things. Things that people actually pay for. Things that the algorithm rewards."

The word algorithm sits between them. They both know what it means. They've both read the forums, the discussions, the analyses of how Heri's system works, how it pushes creators toward increasingly extreme content, how it rewards danger and degradation and boundary-crossing because that's what sells, that's what consumers want, that's what makes money in an attention economy that's already seen everything safe, everything vanilla, everything that doesn't push limits or violate norms or give people experiences they can't have in their regular lives.

The algorithm is neutral. That's what the company says. It just measures engagement, just tracks what people watch, what they finish, what they rate highly, what they buy again. It's just data. Just mathematics. Just the market speaking, showing what it wants, what it values, what it's willing to pay for. The algorithm isn't making choices. People are making choices. The algorithm is just reflecting those choices back, just optimizing for them, just helping creators understand what the market demands so they can supply it more efficiently.

But reflection and creation aren't as different as they pretend to be. Showing people what they want makes them want it more. Optimizing for engagement creates more engagement of that type. The algorithm doesn't just measure the market—it shapes it, trains it, teaches consumers to want increasingly extreme content by constantly offering it, by making it the recommendation, by pushing it to the top of feeds and search results until extreme becomes normal, until normal becomes boring, until boring becomes invisible, until the only way to be seen is to go further, push harder, cross more lines, violate more boundaries, give people things they didn't even know they wanted until the algorithm taught them to want it.

And now Simera is about to enter that system. About to feed it. About to let it shape her the way it's shaped thousands of other creators who started with walking tours and ended with things they swore they'd never do, things they promised themselves were off-limits, things they crossed into anyway because the money was there and the bills were due and the algorithm showed them exactly how much more they could make if they just did this one thing, just crossed this one line, just pushed this one boundary and surely that would be enough, surely they could stop there, surely they wouldn't have to keep going further and further until they couldn't recognize themselves anymore.

"I'm scared," Simera says. The admission comes out quiet, almost inaudible, the kind of truth you have to say softly because saying it loudly would make it too real, would give it too much power, would acknowledge just how terrifying this is, how permanent, how transformative, how much of a cliff she's standing on the edge of and how far the fall is and how uncertain the landing.

Liz's hand reaches across the table-door. Finds Simera's. Holds it. The touch is warm, real, immediate. Liz's palm has calluses from her own work, her own scamming, her own methods of survival that are ethically questionable but at least don't require selling her body, her experiences, her self in quite as direct a way. The calluses are rough against Simera's skin. She counts them: four on Liz's right hand, from typing, from manipulating forms, from the repetitive small violences of keyboard work. Four calluses that mark her girlfriend's labor, her efforts, her attempts to keep them both alive through cleverness and deception and finding the angles in systems designed to crush them.

"I know you're scared," Liz says. "I'm scared too."

"Yeah?"

"Terrified. But not of you doing this. I'm scared of what it costs. What it changes. What it makes you become." She squeezes Simera's hand. "But I'm going to be here. Whatever happens. Whatever this turns into. Whatever you have to do or become to survive this. I'm not going anywhere."

"What if I change? What if I become someone you don't recognize, don't like, don't want to be with?"

"Then I'll love the new person. I'll figure out who you're becoming and I'll love her too. That's what this is, Sim. That's what love is supposed to be. Not loving the easy version of you, the comfortable version, the version that never has to make hard choices or do terrible things to survive. It's loving all the versions. The scared version. The desperate version. The version that's about to commodify herself because that's the only way forward. I'll love that version too. I promise."

Simera wants to believe it. Wants to believe that love is that strong, that resilient, that capable of surviving what's coming. But she's seen too much. Read too many forum posts from creators whose relationships failed, whose partners couldn't handle what they were doing, who said they'd be supportive but weren't, who promised to stay but left, who meant their promises when they made them but discovered that meaning a promise and keeping a promise are different things, that the gap between intention and action gets wider the harder things get, the more degrading the work becomes, the more the person you love transforms into someone you don't recognize.

But she nods. Accepts the promise. Chooses to believe because what else can she do? What else is left?

"I need to set some boundaries," Liz says. "Not for you. For me. Things I need you to know, need you to hear, before you start this. Because once you start, things are going to move fast. The algorithm will push you. The money will tempt you. The desperation will drive you. And I need you to know where my lines are, what I can handle and what I can't, what will make me stay and what will make me leave. Not as a threat. Just as information. Just as the truth."

"Okay."

"First: I need you to be honest with me. About what you're recording. About how far you're going. About what you're doing even if you think it will hurt me to know. Especially if you think it will hurt me to know. Because secrets are worse than truth. Lies are worse than pain. If you start hiding things from me, if you start performing for me the way you'll be performing for the camera, we're done. Not because I'm judging you but because we can't be partners if we're not honest. And honesty is the one thing, the only thing, that I need from you no matter what else happens."

Simera nods. Counts: one boundary. One requirement. One thing Liz needs that Simera can give, has to give, will promise to give even though she knows, suspects, fears that this promise will be harder to keep than it sounds, that there will be times when honesty feels impossible, when truth feels too dangerous, when lying seems kinder than revealing what she's done, what she's become, what she's sold.

"Second," Liz continues, "I need you to remember that you're doing this for us. For survival. Not for the thrill, not for the validation, not because you want to. Because you have to. Because we have no other options. The moment it becomes about something else—the moment you start enjoying it, start seeking it out, start doing more extreme things because you want to rather than because you need to—I need you to tell me. I need you to stop and think about what's happening. Because that's when people lose themselves. That's when the job becomes an addiction. That's when creators stop being people who make content and become content themselves, completely consumed by the thing they thought they were controlling."

Two boundaries. Two requirements. This one is harder. Because how do you measure motivation? How do you distinguish between doing something because you have to and doing something because you want to when wanting and having-to blur together, when necessity and desire become indistinguishable, when the reasons you started doing something stop mattering because you're doing it now and the doing has its own momentum, its own logic, its own gravity that pulls you forward regardless of why you started falling in the first place?

"Third," Liz says, and her voice is quieter now, more hesitant, like this boundary is the hardest one to speak, the most vulnerable one to admit, "I need you to still be mine. Not in a possessive way. Not like I own you. But in a—in the way that matters. I need to know that what you're doing with other people, what you're recording, what you're selling—it's just performance. It's just work. It's not real. Not the way we're real. Not the way this is real." She gestures between them, at the space where their hands meet, at the connection that's held them together through months of poverty, through desperation, through all the grinding daily humiliations of trying to survive when the world is designed to kill you. "I need to know I'm still your person. That this, us, what we have—it's still the real thing. Everything else is just commodity. Just performance. Just survival. But this is real. I need you to promise me that."

Three boundaries. Three requirements. Three things Liz needs that Simera has to give, wants to give, means to give right now in this moment when she's still herself, still capable of promises, still someone who can make commitments and mean them and believe she'll keep them.

But she knows—suspects, fears, can already feel it like a storm approaching—that promises made before the fall are different from promises kept after the landing. That the person sitting here making promises is not the same person who will exist in a month, in three months, in six months after she's been recording herself, selling herself, performing herself for strangers who will consume her and rate her and demand more, always more, always further, always something she swore she wouldn't do until the math changes and the numbers speak and survival requires crossing another line, breaking another promise, becoming another version of herself that she didn't anticipate, didn't choose, but became anyway because becoming is what happens when you stop resisting, when you let the current take you, when you accept that you're already falling and the only question is how you fall, how you sell the fall, how you make the fall profitable enough to justify the landing.

"I promise," Simera says. "All three. I'll be honest. I'll remember why I'm doing this. And you'll always be my person. This will always be real. Everything else is just—just business. Just survival. Just the thing I have to do so we can keep being us."

Liz's eyes are wet. Not crying, not quite, just wet with the tears she's holding back because crying would make this harder, would make Simera doubt, would introduce emotions that are true but not helpful, that are valid but not survivable right now when survival requires action, requires commitment, requires stepping off the edge and hoping you land somewhere that's better than where you're standing even if better is relative, even if better still looks like a different kind of suffering, just one that pays the rent.

"Okay," Liz says. "Okay. Then do it. Calibrate the device. Start this thing. Take the first step." She squeezes Simera's hand one more time, then releases it. "I'm going to go lie down. My stomach is killing me. Took my second-to-last painkiller twenty minutes ago and it hasn't kicked in yet. Let me know when you're done setting it up."

She stands. Moves to the mattress. Lies down in her usual position: on her side, knees pulled up, hands on her stomach like she's trying to hold in the pain, contain it, keep it from spreading through her whole body even though pain doesn't work that way, pain doesn't stay contained, pain is liquid, invasive, it finds every crack and fills it and eventually it's everywhere, it's everything, it's all you can feel.

Simera watches her girlfriend curl around her own suffering and counts: seven painkillers left after the one Liz just took. Seven pills to last until they can afford more, which they can't, which they won't be able to until Simera makes money from this, until she records something, uploads it, collects payment, turns her experiences into income that can be converted back into medication, into relief, into the temporary absence of pain that's the best Liz can hope for, the best either of them can hope for, the best this world offers to people like them—not the end of suffering but the management of suffering, not relief but the temporary postponement of relief's absence.

Seven pills. She does the math: if Liz takes one every three days, that's twenty-one days. Three weeks. But three days between pills assumes her pain stays at current levels, assumes it doesn't get worse, assumes she can stretch the medication through sheer willpower and tolerance and the acceptance of baseline suffering that she's learned to function through. If the pain gets worse—and it always gets worse, that's the nature of chronic conditions, they don't improve, they escalate—seven pills might last two weeks. Maybe less.

Two weeks to make money. Two weeks to record something, upload it, build an audience, start generating income. Two weeks before Liz runs out of medication and the pain becomes unbearable and they have to choose between buying painkillers or paying rent or eating or any of the other impossible choices poverty forces on you, any of the other calculations where every option is bad and you just pick the least-worst one and call it a decision, call it agency, call it choice when what it really is is surrender disguised as selection.

Two weeks.

The timeline is tight. The timeline is urgent. The timeline is why she's sitting here with a recording device in front of her instead of still looking for jobs that don't exist, still applying to positions that won't hire her, still pretending there are other options when the math has already been done and the numbers only work one way.

Simera picks up the device. Turns it over in her hands. The manual says calibration is simple. Says it's painless. Says it only takes twenty minutes and then she'll be ready, equipped, prepared to start creating content, to start recording herself, to start the process of becoming what she consumes, what thousands of other desperate people have become, what the system requires you to become if you're poor enough, broken enough, desperate enough to accept that your experiences are commodities, your body is a product, your self is something that can be packaged and sold and consumed by strangers.

The device has a single button. She presses it.

The screen lights up: blue-white, cold, clinical. Text scrolls across:

HERI CREATOR PRO v.4.7  
INITIALIZING...  
PLEASE CONNECT TO NEURAL PORT

She reaches behind her right ear. Her fingers find the port—the small metal jack embedded in her skull that everyone has, that they install when you're born, that's become so normal, so standard, so universal that people forget it's there, forget it's an invasion, forget that you came into this world with a hole drilled in your head so corporations could plug directly into your brain, so the market could have direct access to your consciousness, so commodification could be not just economic but neurological, not just metaphorical but literal.

The cable from the device ends in a medical-grade jack. Sterile. Silver. Cold. She brings it to her port. The connection is familiar—she's done this thousands of times, plugging in to consume Mementos, to escape, to experience other people's lives. But this is different. This isn't consuming. This is preparing to be consumed. This isn't downloading someone else's consciousness. This is getting ready to upload her own.

The difference feels vast. Feels unbridgeable. Feels like the distance between being a person and being a product, between having experiences and selling experiences, between living and performing life for an audience that will judge you, rate you, consume you, and demand more.

She plugs it in.

The connection is immediate. She feels it—not physically, the port is nerve-dead, they design them that way so people don't feel pain every time they plug in—but neurologically, psychologically, the deep recognition that something has entered her, has accessed her, has connected to the most fundamental part of what makes her herself. The device is reading her now. Scanning her neural patterns, her consciousness structures, her thought processes. Learning her. Mapping her. Preparing to record her.

The screen displays: CALIBRATING... 18:47 REMAINING

Eighteen minutes and forty-seven seconds. She counts them. Watches the timer decrease. 18:46. 18:45. 18:44. Each second is one more second of her brain being analyzed, categorized, prepared for commodification. Each second is one more second closer to becoming a creator, to crossing the line, to starting down the path that she knows, suspects, fears has no real exit, no way to uncross back to who she was before, no method of returning to the person sitting here right now making promises she means to keep but probably won't, setting boundaries she intends to maintain but probably can't, believing this is just temporary, just survival, just what she has to do until something better comes along even though better never comes along for people like her, even though temporary has a way of becoming permanent, even though survival has a way of consuming everything until there's nothing left but surviving, nothing left but the daily performance of still being alive even when being alive has stopped meaning anything except not being dead yet.

The calibration continues. 15:23. 15:22. 15:21. Simera sits at the table-door and watches the timer count down and tries not to think about what she's doing, what she's about to do, what this device will enable her to do. Tries not to think about the forums she read, the creators who started with walking tours and ended up doing things they never imagined, never planned, never wanted until they needed to, until the algorithm pushed them, until the market demanded it, until their options narrowed and narrowed until there were no options left except further, harder, more extreme, more degrading, more profitable.

Tries not to think about the promises she just made to Liz. The three boundaries. The three requirements. Honesty. Remembering why she's doing this. Keeping their relationship real while everything else becomes performance. Tries not to think about how every creator forum she read had stories of broken promises, violated boundaries, relationships destroyed because the line between performance and reality eroded, because the job became an addiction, because the money made it easy to rationalize one more thing, just one more boundary crossed, just one more compromise made in service of survival that stopped being survival and became something else, something worse, something that looked like success from the outside but felt like dissolution from the inside.

Tries not to think.

Just counts.

12:34. 12:33. 12:32.

Counting is safe. Counting is neutral. Counting doesn't require her to feel, to process, to acknowledge what's happening. Counting is just mathematics, just numbers descending, just time passing in discrete measurable units that she can track, can predict, can control in the only way control is still available to her—not control over what happens, but control over how she measures what happens, how she quantifies it, how she turns the overwhelming into the countable, the unbearable into discrete units of seconds and minutes that pass one at a time and eventually, inevitably, arrive at zero.

09:17. 09:16. 09:15.

Her phone buzzes. She picks it up. A notification from the Memento app:

FREEFALL_CREATOR PROFILE CREATED  
Set up your payment info to start earning!

She set up the account yesterday. Created her creator name. Selected her content categories. Wrote her bio. Did everything except acquire the equipment, except calibrate the device, except actually commit to starting this, to doing this, to becoming this.

But now the equipment is here. The device is calibrating. The account exists. The infrastructure is in place. All that's left is the action. All that's left is to actually record something, upload it, cross from planning to execution, from preparation to participation, from thinking about being a creator to actually being one.

All that's left is everything.

06:42. 06:41. 06:40.

Simera opens the app. Navigates to the creator portal. It looks different from the consumer interface—more clinical, more businesslike, more focused on metrics and analytics and optimization. The consumer side is designed to seduce, to invite, to make escape look appealing. The creator side is designed to extract, to measure, to turn you into a participant in your own exploitation with dashboards and graphs and numbers that show you exactly how much you're making, how many people are watching, what's working and what's not, what you should do more of if you want to maximize earnings, if you want to optimize engagement, if you want to succeed in the attention economy that treats human experience as raw material to be mined, processed, packaged, and sold.

The payment setup screen asks for her bank information. She enters it. Routing number. Account number. The bank account with sixty-seven dollars in it. Sixty-seven dollars that's supposed to last until she makes money from this, until she becomes profitable, until her experiences start generating income that can be deposited, withdrawn, spent on rent and food and Liz's medication and all the other costs of staying alive that never stop, never decrease, just keep accumulating like debt, like interest, like the bill for existing in a world that charges you for everything including the privilege of continuing to exist.

PAYMENT INFO VERIFIED  
You're ready to start earning!

03:21. 03:20. 03:19.

The calibration is almost done. Three minutes left. Simera looks at Liz on the mattress. Her girlfriend is curled tight, breathing shallow, the breathing of someone in pain trying to minimize movement, trying to exist as quietly as possible in a body that's screaming. The painkiller still hasn't fully kicked in. It will, eventually—in another fifteen, twenty minutes, Liz's breathing will deepen, her body will relax, she'll get maybe three or four hours of reduced pain before it starts coming back, before the medication wears off and she's left with just her body's baseline agony that she's learned to call manageable, learned to function through, learned to accept as the price of being alive in this body, in this life, in this system that doesn't care about suffering unless suffering can be monetized, unless pain can be turned into profit for someone else.

Seven pills left. Two weeks. Maybe less.

The math is simple. The timeline is urgent. The choice has already been made.

01:47. 01:46. 01:45.

Simera watches the timer count down and makes decisions. Not big decisions—those have already been made, the big choice was made when she bought the device, when she maxed out the credit card, when she set up the creator account, when she sat here with Liz and promised three things she means to keep but probably won't, not because she's a liar but because promises made before you start selling yourself are different from promises kept while you're doing it, while you're in it, while you're becoming it.

But small decisions. Practical decisions. What to record first. Where. When.

The walking tour is safe. The walking tour is easy. The walking tour is something she can do tonight—just walk through the city with the device recording, just exist in space and let other people experience that existence, let them see what she sees, feel what she feels, be present in a place they can't access or are too afraid to access or just want to experience secondhand because secondhand is safer, cheaper, easier than actually doing things, actually going places, actually living instead of consuming other people's living.

She can do that. She can walk through the city at night. She's done it before—not recording, just existing, just moving through space because walking is free and sometimes you need to get out of the apartment before the walls finish closing in, before the claustrophobia becomes unbearable, before you suffocate on poverty that has physical weight, physical presence, physical suffocation.

She can do that tonight. Record for an hour, maybe two. Come home. Upload it. See what happens. See if anyone watches. See if anyone pays. See if this works, if the math actually works, if turning yourself into content actually generates income that's more than the cost of generating it, that's actually profit instead of just a different kind of loss, a different kind of expense, a different price paid for survival that costs more than surviving is worth.

The device beeps three times. Soft, mechanical, final. The sound of a door closing behind you. The sound of a choice becoming irreversible. The sound of calibration completing and there's no more preparation left, no more steps to take before the actual thing, the actual action, the actual crossing of the line from consumer to creator, from person to product, from Simera to FreeFall_Creator, from someone who experiences life to someone who performs life for other people to consume.

She unplugs the cable from her port. The disconnection is immediate, total. The device has learned her. The device knows her now. The device can recognize her neural patterns, can track them, can record them and turn them into data that other people will download and experience and rate and review and consume.

The device is ready.

The question is whether she is.

Simera stands. Carries the device to the window. Looks out at the alley, at the gray afternoon turning to gray evening, at the city beyond visible in fragments through the narrow gap between buildings. The city where she'll walk tonight. The city she'll record. The city that will become her first product, her first commodity, her first uploaded experience that strangers will pay to consume.

She counts: four visible windows in the building across the alley. Eleven stories visible from this angle. Three pieces of trash on the ground below. Two pigeons on a fire escape. Numbers that don't mean anything except that she's counting them, except that counting is what she does when she's stressed, when she's scared, when she's about to do something irreversible and needs to control some small piece of it, needs to measure something, needs to turn chaos into discrete units that can be tracked, tallied, contained.

"Sim?" Liz's voice from the mattress. Rough with pain but conscious, present. "You done?"

"Yeah. It's calibrated."

"How do you feel?"

How does she feel? The question is enormous. The question is impossible. The question assumes feelings are simple, identifiable, nameable, when what she actually feels is a vast undifferentiated mass of anxiety and determination and fear and resignation and hope and despair and the sense of standing at the edge of a building about to jump not because she wants to but because staying on the roof is no longer an option, because the building is burning and jumping is the only exit even though jumping means falling means risking everything means maybe dying but at least dying is a choice, is an action, is movement instead of paralysis, is something instead of nothing.

"I don't know," Simera says. "Scared. Ready. Both. Neither."

"That's honest."

"You asked for honesty."

"I did." Liz sits up slowly, carefully, one hand on her stomach. The painkiller has started working—not fully, but enough that she can move without gasping, can exist without curling around her own agony. "You know what you're doing first?"

"Walking tour. Tonight. Just walk through the city with it recording. Nothing extreme. Nothing dangerous. Just existing in space and letting people experience that."

"That doesn't sound bad."

"It's not. That's the point. Start small. Start safe. Start with something I'd do anyway so it doesn't feel like performance, doesn't feel like work, doesn't feel like selling myself because I'm just doing what I'd normally do except this time it's recorded."

Liz nods. She understands. She always understands. That's one of the things Simera loves about her—the ability to see the logic in things without endorsing them, to understand why without agreeing that why is enough, to hold space for complexity instead of demanding simplicity, instead of making everything a moral binary where things are either right or wrong and there's no middle ground, no gray area, no space for people who are doing wrong things for right reasons or right things that feel wrong or survival that requires compromise, requires crossing lines, requires becoming something you swore you'd never become.

"You want me to come with you?" Liz asks.

"You're in pain."

"I'm always in pain. The question is whether you want company. Whether you want to do this alone or whether you want me there even though I won't be in the recording, even though viewers won't know I'm there, even though it'll be invisible labor, invisible support, invisible presence that won't get compensated, won't get credited, won't get acknowledged except by you and me knowing that I was there, that you weren't alone, that we did this together even though together looks like you performing and me watching, you selling and me supporting you selling yourself because we need the money and this is how we get it."

The offer is genuine. Simera can hear it in Liz's voice—the willingness to come, to be present, to witness this first crossing, this first recording, this first step into a future they can't see clearly but are entering anyway because not entering means staying here, staying broke, staying desperate, staying in a one-room apartment counting cracks in the ceiling and days until eviction and pills until Liz's pain becomes unbearable.

But Simera shakes her head. "I need to do this alone. I need to—I need to figure out what it feels like. What it means. Who I am when I'm doing it. And I can't figure that out if you're there. If I'm conscious of you watching. If I'm performing for you while I'm performing for the device while I'm performing for the future audience who will consume this. Too many layers. Too many audiences. Too many versions of myself to maintain simultaneously."

"Okay." No argument. No hurt feelings. Just acceptance. Just understanding. Just Liz being Liz, being the person who gets it, who always gets it, who makes space for Simera's needs even when those needs exclude her, even when being supportive means being absent, even when love looks like letting someone do something alone that they shouldn't have to do alone but need to anyway.

"I'll go tonight," Simera continues. "After dark. When the city lights are on. When it looks more interesting, more atmospheric, more like something people would pay to experience. I'll walk for an hour, maybe two. Record it all. Come back. Upload it. See what happens."

"And then?"

"And then we wait. See if anyone watches. See if anyone pays. See if this works."

"And if it doesn't work? If no one watches? If you make nothing?"

The question hangs in the air. Simera counts: four walls, twelve by nine paces, seventeen bills still unpaid, seven painkillers remaining, sixty-seven dollars in the bank, one walking tour that might make zero dollars, might make five dollars, might make fifty, she has no idea, has no way to predict, has no control over whether this works except to do it, to try, to put herself out there and hope someone wants what she's selling, hope her experiences are worth consuming, hope she's worth consuming.

"If it doesn't work," Simera says slowly, "then I try something else. Something more marketable. Something people actually pay for. Something further, harder, more extreme. Something that crosses more boundaries. Something that—" She stops. Can't finish the sentence. Can't say out loud what something else means, what it looks like, what it will cost her to do, to be, to become.

But Liz understands anyway. Liz always understands.

"One step at a time," Liz says. "Do the walking tour first. See what happens. Don't catastrophize about hypotheticals. Don't plan for failure before you've even tried. Just do this one thing. This one small relatively safe thing. And then we'll figure out next steps after we see how this step goes."

One step at a time. It's good advice. Practical advice. The kind of advice you give someone who's standing at the edge of a cliff about to jump—just take one step, just put one foot in front of the other, don't think about the whole fall, don't think about the landing, just think about the next step, the next moment, the next decision that needs to be made.

"Okay," Simera says. "One step."

---

Night falls slowly, then all at once. The way it always does in the city—the gray afternoon stretches and stretches until suddenly it's dark, until suddenly the lights are on, until suddenly the world has transformed from gray to black punctuated by artificial illumination, by the sodium glow of streetlights and the neon of storefronts and the thousand lit windows that mark other people's lives happening in parallel, simultaneously, all these people living and dying and surviving and surrendering in the same city at the same time, none of them knowing each other, none of them aware that Simera is about to walk among them recording, that she's about to turn their collective presence into her product, that she's about to commodify not just herself but the city itself, the atmosphere itself, the fact of existence itself in a space where existence can be captured, recorded, sold.

Simera stands at the door of their apartment. She's dressed simply: dark jeans, dark jacket, dark sneakers. She looks like anyone. Like everyone. Like another person walking through the city at night for any reason—going somewhere, coming from somewhere, just moving through space without destination, without purpose, without anything that marks her as different, as special, as someone performing life instead of just living it.

The recording device is in her jacket pocket. Small enough to fit, heavy enough that she's aware of it constantly, feels its weight against her ribs like a second heart, like an organ that doesn't belong there but has been installed anyway, surgically, permanently, part of her anatomy now even though it's external, even though she could theoretically remove it, could theoretically put it away and never use it and stay the person she is right now instead of becoming the person she'll be after tonight, after she starts recording, after she crosses this line.

But she won't remove it. Can't remove it. The math doesn't allow for removal. The math requires action. The math says: seven pills, sixty-seven dollars, seventeen bills, two weeks, zero other options.

The math says: record.

The cable trails from her pocket up the back of her jacket, under her hair, to the port behind her ear. Connected. Ready. Waiting for her to press the button, to start the recording, to begin the process of turning the next hour of her life into data that can be uploaded, purchased, consumed.

She hasn't pressed the button yet. She's standing in the doorway, hand on the knob, frozen in this moment before action, this pause before transformation, this last instant of being the person she's been for twenty-six years before she becomes FreeFall_Creator, before she becomes someone who sells experiences, someone who performs life, someone who has crossed from the consumer side to the creator side of exploitation.

"You'll be great," Liz says from the mattress. She's sitting up, looking at Simera with eyes that are worried and supportive and scared and trying not to show any of it because showing it would make this harder. "Just be yourself. Just exist. Just walk and look and feel and let the device capture that. Don't try to perform. Don't try to be interesting. Just be. That's enough. You're enough."

You're enough. The phrase is meant to be encouraging but lands strange. Because the whole point is that she's not enough—not enough income, not enough options, not enough ways to survive except this, not enough value in the normal labor market to make a living, not enough worth in the regular economy to be anything except poor, desperate, forced to commodify herself because herself is the only asset she has left, the only thing she can sell that anyone wants to buy.

She's not enough. That's why she's doing this. If she was enough, she wouldn't need to. If she was enough, there would be other options. If she was enough, the system would have space for her that doesn't require selling herself, that doesn't require turning her experiences into products, that doesn't require performing life instead of living it.

But she nods. Accepts the encouragement. Takes the love underneath the words even if the words themselves aren't true, even if the premise is false, even if the reality is that she's not enough and has never been enough and will never be enough in a system designed to make people insufficient, to make them desperate, to make them willing to do whatever survival requires because survival requires everything, demands everything, takes everything and gives back just barely enough to keep you alive so you can keep giving, keep selling, keep performing yourself for audiences who consume you and discard you and demand more.

"Thank you," Simera says. "I'll be back in a couple hours."

"Be safe."

"I will."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

The words are true. The words are real. The words are the only solid thing in a world that's become liquid, unstable, a world where she's about to walk out into the night and start recording herself and she doesn't know who she'll be when she comes back, doesn't know if the person who returns will still be the person Liz loves, doesn't know if this first step is just a first step or if it's the beginning of a fall that has no bottom, no landing, just endless descent into versions of herself that she can't anticipate, can't prepare for, can't stop from arriving.

But the words are true now. In this moment. In this doorway. Before she leaves.

"I love you too," Simera says again, because saying it twice makes it more real, makes it more solid, makes it something she can hold onto when everything else becomes uncertain, becomes performance, becomes product.

Then she opens the door and leaves.

---

The city at night is a different animal than the city in daylight. Simera has always known this, but tonight it feels more true, more obvious, more significant. Daytime city is mechanical, functional, all purpose and efficiency and people moving through space to get somewhere else, to do something else, lives that are legible, comprehensible, contained in the logic of work and commerce and obligation. But nighttime city is something else. Nighttime city is where the edges blur, where purpose becomes optional, where people exist for their own inscrutable reasons that don't need to be explained or justified or made sense of.

She walks.

Just walks. No destination. No plan. Just motion through space, just her feet carrying her forward, just existing in the city at night with the device recording, with the cable connecting her brain to the machine that's capturing this, that's turning this into data, that's making this walk into a product that someone will pay to experience.

She hasn't pressed the button yet.

She's been walking for eleven minutes—she counts, of course she counts—and she hasn't started recording because starting recording means committing, means this is real, means she's actually doing this, actually becoming this, actually crossing this line. As long as she's just walking with the device connected but not recording, she's still herself, still just Simera walking through the city, still someone who could turn around, go home, put the device away, never use it, never upload anything, never become a creator, stay on the consumer side of exploitation where at least you're familiar with your own degradation.

But she's not going to turn around. She knows that. She's just delaying. Just extending this last moment of being who she's been before becoming who she's about to be.

She stops walking. Stands on a corner under a streetlight. The light above her is sodium-vapor, orange-yellow, the color of old photographs, the color of memory, the color of things that used to be present but have become past. The street in front of her is mostly empty—three visible people within her count, two walking away, one standing in a doorway smoking, the smoke rising into the orange light like thoughts made visible, like consciousness given form and weight and the ability to dissipate.

Simera reaches into her pocket. Finds the device. Her thumb finds the button.

She counts: three breaths. Four heartbeats. Seven cars that pass while she stands here deciding, committing, becoming.

This is it. The threshold. The moment. Once she presses this button, once she starts recording, she's not just thinking about being a creator, not just preparing to be a creator, not just rationalizing becoming a creator. She is one. The act makes it true. The recording makes it real. There's no taking it back, no pretending it didn't happen, no remaining the person who hasn't crossed this line.

Her thumb rests on the button. The button is slightly raised, textured, designed so you know when you're touching it even without looking. A small circle of plastic that represents everything—the decision, the transformation, the crossing, the fall.

She thinks about Liz. About the three boundaries. About honesty, about remembering why, about keeping what's real real. About the promises she just made that she means in this moment but suspects, fears, knows she won't be able to keep, not all of them, not forever, not once the algorithm starts pushing her, once the money starts coming or not coming, once desperation makes the next compromise seem necessary, inevitable, just one more line crossed, just one more boundary violated, just one more version of herself sold.

She thinks about the woman in the video. Ash. Eighteen thousand dollars a month. The loft apartment. The life that doesn't look like poverty. The escape.

She thinks about Liz curled on the mattress, hands on her stomach, seven pills left.

She presses it.

The device vibrates once—a brief pulse against her ribs, confirmation that the recording has started, that her consciousness is now being captured, encoded, turned into data. A small red light appears on the screen: REC.

Nothing changes. That's the first thing she notices. The world looks the same. The street is still there. The orange light is still orange. The person in the doorway is still smoking. Nothing has transformed except her—except that now she's recording, now the device is capturing her neural patterns, her perceptions, her experiences, now everything she sees and feels and thinks is being turned into data that will be uploaded and sold and consumed by strangers.

Now she's performing.

Except she's not performing. That was Liz's advice: don't perform, just be, just exist. Let the recording capture existence instead of performance. Because performance is fake, is recognizable as fake, and consumers can tell when you're faking, when you're trying too hard, when you're not actually experiencing what you're claiming to experience.

So Simera just walks. Just continues what she was doing before she pressed the button. Just moves through the city with the device recording, with her brain patterns being captured and encoded and turned into a commodity.

She walks down streets she knows, streets she's walked before, streets that are familiar but look different now that they're being recorded, now that they're becoming product. Or maybe they don't look different. Maybe that's the point. Maybe the horror is that they look exactly the same, that turning your life into content doesn't change what your life looks like, doesn't transform your experiences, just adds this invisible layer of commodification, of performance, of being-watched-ness that you carry with you everywhere now, that colors everything even though nothing visible has changed.

The recording continues. She keeps walking. Counts: fourteen blocks. Twenty-seven streetlights. Forty-one visible windows lit from inside, each one a life happening in parallel, each one someone else surviving or failing to survive or surrendering to survival's costs. 

She passes a bodega with a cat sleeping in the window. Orange tabby, curled in a perfect circle on a stack of lottery tickets. The cat doesn't care about commodification. Doesn't care about content creation. Just sleeps in warm light, existing without performance, without audience, without the weight of being watched. Simera feels something twist in her chest—envy, maybe, or grief for a kind of unselfconscious being she might never access again now that she's recording, now that existence itself has become performance whether she intends it or not.

Two teenage girls pass her going the opposite direction, laughing at something on a phone, their voices bright with that particular hilarity that only exists at sixteen, when everything is simultaneously terrible and hilarious, when tragedy and comedy are the same thing. They don't look at her. Don't know they're being recorded. Don't know they're becoming part of her product, that their laughter is now data she owns, will sell, that others will consume.

That feels wrong. Feels like theft. Feels like she's stealing something from these strangers who didn't consent, who don't know, who are just existing in public space assuming public space is still public, is still shared, is still something other than raw material for content creators to mine and process and sell.

But it's legal. That's what the terms of service said. That's what the creator guidelines explained. Recording in public spaces is legal. People in public spaces have no expectation of privacy. By existing in public, they're consenting to be recorded, to be captured, to become part of other people's content. The law says so. The platform says so. The whole infrastructure says so.

So Simera keeps walking, keeps recording, keeps capturing these strangers who don't know they're becoming products, keeps turning the city into data, keeps performing existence while trying not to perform, keeps being herself while being herself is now a commodity, a product, a thing that will be sold.

She turns down a street she's never walked before. The buildings here are older, more beautiful—pre-war architecture, the kind with actual ornamentation, with gargoyles and cornices and details that cost money to create, that nobody builds anymore because beauty without function is unmarketable, unsellable, economically irrational. The streetlights here cast different shadows. Longer. More dramatic. The kind of shadows that make the city look like it has a soul, like it's alive in ways that can't be quantified, that resist commodification even as she's commodifying them right now, turning beauty into data, turning soul into sellable content.

An old man sits on a stoop. He's smoking. Not cigarettes—something else, something that smells like cloves and autumn and things that used to exist but don't anymore. He looks at her as she passes. Really looks. Not through her, not past her, but at her. Sees her. And for a moment she wonders if he can tell, if there's something visible about being recorded, some aura or emanation that marks you as product, as content, as someone who's crossed from being to performing being.

But he just nods. Tips an invisible hat. Goes back to his smoking.

The city breathes around her. She can feel it—the pulse of it, the life of it, the way it moves and shifts and changes even when nothing visible is changing. Somewhere a siren wails. Somewhere glass breaks. Somewhere someone is loving someone. Somewhere someone is hurting someone. All of it happening simultaneously, all of it part of the vast anonymous machinery of urban existence where millions of people live parallel lives that never intersect, never touch, never acknowledge each other except in these brief moments of proximity, of passing, of existing in the same space at the same time without ever really meeting.

And she's recording it. Capturing it. Turning it into a product that people will consume in their own apartments, in their own poverty, in their own desperate need to experience something other than their own lives. She's becoming the bridge between their loneliness and someone else's loneliness, the translator of experience into commodity, the person who turns living into content so that others can consume living without the risk of actually doing it.

Fifty-three minutes. She's been recording for fifty-three minutes. The device battery shows 61%—enough for another two hours, maybe three. She could keep going. Could record more. Could give the eventual consumers more content, more value, more time experiencing her experience of walking through the city at night being herself which is apparently worth consuming, worth paying for, worth turning into a transaction.

But fifty-three minutes feels like enough. Feels like the right length for a first attempt. Feels like a complete unit that can be packaged, uploaded, sold as a discrete experience: one hour of walking through the city at night, one hour of urban exploration, one hour of being present in space in a way that people sitting in their own apartments in their own poverty in their own lives might want to experience, might pay to experience, might consume as escape from their own grinding existence the same way Simera consumes other people's falls, other people's intimacies, other people's experiences that are more intense, more real, more alive than her own life has felt for months, years, maybe always.

She stops walking. Stands under another streetlight. Reaches into her pocket. Presses the button again.

The recording stops.

RECORDING COMPLETE  
DURATION: 00:53:17  
FILE SIZE: 1.8GB  
READY TO UPLOAD

The screen glows in her hand. The light is blue-white, cold, the color of technology, the color of transactions, the color of turning experiences into data into money into survival into whatever comes next.

She's done it. She's recorded her first Memento. She's crossed the line. She's become a creator.

Nothing has changed. She's still standing on a street corner under an orange light in a city that doesn't care whether she's recording or not, doesn't care whether she's selling herself or not, doesn't care whether she survives or not because cities don't care, systems don't care, the world doesn't care about individuals, only about aggregates, only about populations, only about the masses who serve as content and consumers simultaneously, who feed the machine by being both product and purchaser, both commodity and customer, both the thing being sold and the thing doing the buying.

Everything has changed. She's no longer just a consumer. She's a creator now. She's crossed from one side to the other. She's become what she's been consuming. She's entering the system as a participant instead of just a victim, as someone who extracts value instead of someone who has value extracted from them.

Except that's a lie. That's what they want her to believe. That's the narrative the platform sells: become a creator, take control, empower yourself, turn your experiences into income, be your own boss, choose your own path. But she's not more powerful now. She's just exploited differently. She's still being extracted from, just in a different way, at a different level, by a different mechanism that makes her feel like she has agency when what she actually has is just a different role in the same machine, a different position in the same hierarchy, a different method of being crushed that pays slightly better while costing infinitely more.

But it pays. That's the key thing. That's what matters. It pays, and paying means surviving, and surviving is the only goal that matters when you're drowning, when you're desperate, when you're running out of options and out of time and out of everything except the willingness to do whatever needs to be done.

Simera walks home. The walk back takes thirty-one minutes. She counts. Counts blocks, counts streetlights, counts people, counts breaths, counts heartbeats, counts everything because counting is what she does, counting is her compulsion, her disorder, her method of managing chaos, her way of turning the overwhelming into the measurable, the unbearable into discrete units that can be tracked, tallied, controlled in the only way control is available to her.

The apartment is dark when she returns except for the blue glow of Liz's phone. Liz is on the mattress, propped up on pillows, looking at her screen with the expression she gets when she's working, when she's deep in a scam, when she's being someone else, performing someone else, extracting value from systems that extract value from her.

They're the same, Simera realizes. She and Liz. Both of them performing, both of them lying, both of them finding angles in systems designed to crush them, both of them surviving through deception and commodification and the willingness to become what they need to become to stay alive. The only difference is the specific method. Liz scams. Simera records. But they're both selling, both exploiting, both participants in economies that require degradation, that demand compromise, that take everything and give back just enough to keep you desperate enough to keep giving, keep selling, keep performing yourself until there's nothing left to perform, until the performance becomes the person, until there's no distinction anymore between who you are and who you're pretending to be.

"Hey," Liz says, looking up. "How'd it go?"

Simera holds up the device. The screen still shows: READY TO UPLOAD.

"I did it," Simera says. "Fifty-three minutes. Just walking. Just existing. Just—just being present in space while the device recorded. That's it. That's the whole thing."

"How does it feel?"

"I don't know. Strange. Wrong. Normal. All of those at once. I can't tell yet what I've done, what this means, who I am now that I've done it."

Liz pats the mattress beside her. "Come here. Upload it tomorrow. Tonight just be here with me. Just be yourself. Not FreeFall_Creator. Not the person who records. Just Simera. Just my person. Just you."

Simera crosses the room. Six paces. She counts them. Lies down next to Liz on the mattress that's sunken in the middle, that smells like sleep and poverty and the slow erosion of hope. Liz sets her phone aside. Wraps an arm around Simera. The touch is warm, real, immediate. Not performance. Not commodity. Just human connection, just presence, just the thing that makes surviving feel like something other than just not dying yet.

"I'm scared," Simera whispers.

"I know."

"What if this changes me? What if I become someone else?"

"Then I'll love someone else. We talked about this. I'll love whoever you become."

"But what if you can't? What if I become someone unloveable?"

Liz is quiet for a long moment. Then: "I don't think that's possible. I don't think there's a version of you that I couldn't love. But if there is—if you become that—then we'll deal with it then. Not now. Not hypothetically. If and when it happens, we'll face it. Together."

Together. The word should be comforting. Should be reassuring. Should feel like safety, like certainty, like something solid in a world that's liquid. But Simera knows, suspects, fears that together has limits, that there are versions of her that Liz can't follow into, can't love through, can't survive being in relationship with. That promises made now won't survive the future. That together is conditional, temporary, subject to change when she changes, when she becomes what the market demands, what the algorithm rewards, what survival requires.

But tonight the word is enough. Tonight together is true even if it won't always be. Tonight she's still mostly the person Liz fell in love with, still mostly herself, still mostly un-commodified except for fifty-three minutes of recorded walking that hasn't been uploaded yet, hasn't been sold yet, hasn't transformed from experience into product yet.

Tomorrow she'll upload it. Tomorrow she'll become FreeFall_Creator. Tomorrow she'll find out if her life is valuable enough to sell, if her experiences are worth consuming, if she's worth anything at all in a market that measures worth in engagement metrics, in view counts, in the ability to turn yourself into something people want to consume and discard and consume again.

The numbers will tell her. Tomorrow the numbers will speak. Tomorrow the math will reveal whether she's profitable, whether she's viable, whether she's enough.

But the numbers never tell you what they cost to learn. Never tell you what you pay to discover whether you're worth anything. Never tell you that sometimes the price of knowing your value is losing the ability to value yourself as anything except a number, a metric, a data point in an economy that treats human experience as raw material and human beings as the machines that mine it.

She'll learn that tomorrow. When she uploads. When she crosses the line completely. When the fall really begins.

But not tonight.

Tonight she just lies here with Liz and counts: four walls, twelve by nine paces, one girlfriend, one relationship that's still real, one device in her pocket waiting to upload, one decision already made, one fall already started, one future already approaching.

One night left of being mostly herself.

Simera closes her eyes. Counts her breaths. Counts Liz's breaths. Outside, the city breathes with them. Inside, the ceiling holds its nine water stains and twenty-six cracks, more familiar than her own face, more constant than her own identity, more reliable than her own future.

Liz's warmth against her side. The mattress beneath them, sunken in the middle like a depression they've both worn into it through months of sleeping in the same position, the same way poverty wears grooves into you, shapes you, molds you into forms you didn't choose but become anyway.

Tonight this is enough.

Tomorrow.

But not tonight.

Tonight she counts. One girlfriend. One apartment. One person she is. One person she'll become.

One.

Always one.

The loneliest number. The only number left when everything else has been counted, calculated, commodified, sold.

One way forward. One way out. One way to survive.

And tomorrow she takes it.
