# Chapter 6: First Recording

## Chapter Summary
Simera's first Memento creation. She sets up, activates the device, and puts herself in the scenario she planned. Experience it from her perspective—the awareness that she's recording, the performance aspect, the genuine sensations mixed with self-consciousness. It's strange, uncomfortable, but also exhilarating. Afterward, the odd feeling of having commodified her own experience. The upload to Heri's platform. The waiting for approval and sales. The first payment notification. The complex feelings: triumph, shame, relief, discomfort. Liz's reaction to Simera having done it.

- **Liz**: Seeing Simera differently now, complex emotions, trying to be supportive

## Themes to Explore
- The commodification of experience
- Performance vs. authenticity
- The first taste of success
- Crossing moral/psychological thresholds
- How money changes the meaning of experience

## Atmosphere & Tone
Strange, disorienting, exciting, uncomfortable. A sense of having crossed a one-way threshold. The weird mixture of triumph and loss. The first step into a darker world.

## Writing Notes
- Make the recording experience visceral and strange
- Show the self-consciousness of creating vs. just experiencing
- The first payment as both victory and loss of innocence
- Liz's reaction should be nuanced and complex
- This is a point of no return - make it feel significant
