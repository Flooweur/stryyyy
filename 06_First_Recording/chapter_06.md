# Chapter 6: First Recording

The walking tour made thirty-seven dollars.

Simera checks the number for the nineteenth time in six hours—refreshing the creator portal on her phone, watching the same figure appear: $37.00. Seventeen views. Three ratings, all between three and four stars. Two written reviews:

_Nice atmosphere but nothing really happens. 3/5_

_Good for falling asleep to. Calming. 4/5_

Thirty-seven dollars. Seventeen hours after uploading. The sign-up bonus was two hundred, so total earnings: two hundred and thirty-seven dollars. Minus the two hundred and forty she spent on equipment. Net loss: three dollars. Plus the maxed-out credit card accumulating interest. Plus the eighty dollars she still owes to the payday loan place by Friday. Plus rent. Plus bills. Plus Liz's medication that costs sixty-seven dollars to refill and they have five pills left now—Liz took another one last night, another one this morning when the pain spiked to a level she couldn't function through, couldn't breathe through, couldn't exist through without chemical intervention.

Five pills. Three days between doses if she's careful. Fifteen days. Two weeks. The math hasn't changed except that it's gotten more urgent, more desperate, more impossible.

Thirty-seven dollars.

The number mocks her. The number says: your experiences are barely valuable. Your life as content is worth less than minimum wage. Your fifty-three minutes of existing in space generated thirty-seven dollars divided by seventeen viewers equals two dollars and eighteen cents per view. Your hourly rate for commodifying yourself is approximately forty-two cents per hour including upload time, minus equipment costs makes it negative six cents per hour. You have monetized your existence at a loss. You are worthless. You are less than worthless. You are a failed product in a market that doesn't want what you're selling.

"Stop looking at it," Liz says from the mattress. Her voice is rough, edged with pain. The painkillers aren't working as well anymore. Tolerance builds. Bodies adapt. What used to bring relief now only brings reduction, what used to ease pain now only makes it manageable, what used to be enough stops being enough because bodies are cruel, because chronic conditions escalate, because survival keeps getting more expensive.

Simera locks her phone. Counts: four walls, twelve by nine paces, thirty-seven dollars earned, two hundred and forty spent, negative three net, five pills remaining, two weeks or less until Liz is in agony with no relief, no solution, no way to make the pain stop except methods they can't afford or can't access or can't justify yet, not yet, not until desperation becomes something else, something worse, something absolute.

"The walking tour was too safe," Simera says quietly. "I read the forums. I read the analytics. Safe content doesn't sell. Atmospheric content doesn't sell. People don't pay for calming. They don't pay for nice. They pay for intensity. They pay for danger. They pay for things they're too afraid to do themselves, things they can't access, things that make them feel alive in ways their actual lives don't, can't, won't."

"So you're going to do something dangerous." Not a question. An acknowledgment. Liz knows. Has known. Has been waiting for Simera to say it, to commit to it, to stop pretending that safe content will be enough, that the walking tour was anything more than preparation, was anything more than the first small step before the real fall begins.

"I'm going to do a falling Memento," Simera says.

The words sit in the apartment like objects. Solid. Undeniable. True.

Liz is quiet for seventeen seconds. Simera counts them. Finally: "How high?"

"I don't know yet. High enough that it sells. High enough that people will pay for it. High enough that the fear is real, that the experience is intense, that consumers get their money's worth." Simera's hand is shaking. Just slightly. A tremor she can't control, can't suppress, can't hide. "The forums say falling content is reliably profitable. The analytics say extreme height generates higher engagement. The top falling creators all do buildings over twenty stories. Fifty, sixty, eighty stories. Some do over a hundred."

"Like the one you consume," Liz says. "The one hundred and fourteen floor drop. The hospital gown. The kiss."

"Yeah. Like that one."

"You've paid for that one seven times." Still not judging. Still just stating facts. Still being Liz, being honest, being the person who names truth even when truth is uncomfortable, even when truth reveals things that are hard to acknowledge. "Seven times in the past three months. Twelve ninety-nine each time. Ninety-one dollars total spent on experiencing someone else falling off a building. On experiencing someone else almost dying. On experiencing the same memory over and over because once wasn't enough, because the intensity demands repetition, because addiction looks like consumption that can't stop itself."

"I know."

"And now you're going to be the person creating that. You're going to be the person someone else consumes seven times. You're going to be the product instead of the customer."

"Yes."

"How do you feel about that?"

How does she feel? The question is enormous. The question contains too much. Fear. Determination. Nausea. Relief. Terror. The sense of stepping off a cliff she's been standing on for weeks, stepping off finally, committing finally, becoming finally the thing she's been preparing to become, the thing the math requires her to become, the thing survival demands.

"I feel like I don't have a choice," Simera says. "I feel like the choice was made when the walking tour failed, when it became clear that safe doesn't pay enough, that calming doesn't generate the income we need. I feel like I'm already falling and I'm just now acknowledging it, just now accepting it, just now recording it so at least the fall pays, at least the fall means something, at least the fall solves the problem even if it creates others."

Liz sits up slowly, carefully. Both hands on her stomach. Her face is pale. The pain is worse than she's admitting. It's always worse than she admits. "Where are you going to do it? How are you going to do it? Have you thought about the logistics? About the safety? About what happens if something goes wrong, if the recording fails, if you actually fall instead of just recording yourself falling?"

"There's a building," Simera says. She's been thinking about this since the walking tour uploaded, since the thirty-seven dollars appeared, since the math recalculated itself and made clear that safety is unaffordable, that caution is a luxury, that the only way forward is further, harder, more extreme. "Abandoned office tower on the east side. Twenty-three stories. The top floors are accessible—broken locks, no security, just empty floors and windows you can open. People do BASE jumps from there sometimes. Parkour runners. Content creators. It's known. It's used."

"Twenty-three stories is high enough to die if you actually fall."

"I'm not going to actually fall."

"But you could."

"I could die crossing the street. I could die in this apartment. I could die from poverty slowly grinding me down until my body gives up. Everything is dangerous. Everything has risk. At least this risk pays. At least this danger generates income. At least this way of potentially dying comes with the possibility of survival, of escape, of solving the problems that are definitely killing us instead of maybe killing me."

The logic is sound. The logic is terrible. The logic is the logic of desperation, of people who have run out of safe options and are now calculating which dangerous option is least dangerous, which form of self-destruction is most profitable, which way of hurting yourself generates the most value.

"When?" Liz asks.

"Tonight. Before I lose my nerve. Before I think too much. Before I calculate all the ways this could fail and talk myself out of it and we're back to thirty-seven dollars and five pills and two weeks and drowning."

"I want to come with you."

"No."

"Sim—"

"No. You're in pain. You can barely move. I'm not making you watch this. I'm not making you witness this. I'm not making you complicit in this beyond the fact that we both know it has to happen, that the math requires it, that survival demands it. But you don't have to see it. You don't have to be there. You can be here, be safe, be not-watching while I do this. That's the one kindness I can give you—the absence of witnessing."

Liz's eyes are wet. Not crying. Just wet. Threatening tears that haven't fallen yet, that she's holding back through sheer will. "I hate this."

"I know."

"I hate that you have to do this. I hate that we're in a situation where this makes sense, where this is the logical choice, where falling off a building is the reasonable response to poverty. I hate the system that created this. I hate that your options are this or drowning. I hate that my pain is the reason, that my medication costs more than we have, that my body is part of the equation that makes you do this."

"It's not your fault."

"I know it's not my fault. But I still hate it. I still hate that we're here. I still hate that tonight you're going to climb twenty-three stories and record yourself falling and I'm going to be here counting the minutes until you come back and hoping you come back and knowing that even if you come back, the person who comes back might not be the same person who left, might not be the person I know, might be someone who's crossed a line that can't be uncrossed, who's become something new, something stranger, something I'll have to learn to love all over again."

"You promised you'd love whoever I become."

"I did. I will. I'm just—" Her voice breaks. "I'm just scared. I'm terrified. And I can't ask you not to do it because I know you have to. So I'm asking you to be careful. To be as safe as possible while doing something inherently unsafe. To come back. To please, please come back."

Simera crosses the six paces between them. Sits on the mattress. Takes Liz's hands. Counts: ten fingers, two hands, one girlfriend, one person she loves, one reason to come back, one person worth surviving for, one person who makes the fall worth recording, worth selling, worth monetizing so they can both keep surviving.

"I'll come back," Simera says. "I promise. I'll be careful. I'll be safe. I'll record it and I'll come back and we'll upload it and it'll sell and we'll have money and we'll buy your medication and we'll pay some bills and we'll breathe easier for a little while. That's how this works. That's how this has to work. The alternative is unthinkable."

"The alternative is you dying."

"The alternative is us both dying slowly. Me dying quickly at least has purpose. At least serves a function. At least solves a problem. Dying slowly doesn't solve anything—it just extends the suffering, makes the drowning last longer, makes us watch each other fail piece by piece until there's nothing left to fail."

The logic is terrible. The logic is irrefutable. They both know it. They've both known it for weeks. This conversation is just the acknowledgment, just the speaking-aloud of what mathematics has already determined, what poverty has already decided, what the system has already required.

Liz pulls Simera close. They hold each other. Simera counts: four walls surrounding them, twelve by nine paces of shared space, one mattress on the floor, one relationship that's held together through worse things than this, one love that's strong enough to survive this, or has to be, or will have to learn to be if it isn't already, if love can be learned, if love can be strong enough for this, if love is anything more than another thing poverty destroys while promising it's the one thing poverty can't touch.

"Come back," Liz whispers. "Whatever happens. Whatever you have to do. Just come back."

"I will."

"Promise."

"I promise."

The promise is true. The promise has to be true. The promise is the only solid thing in a world that's become liquid, unstable, a world where she's about to climb twenty-three stories and stand on the edge and record herself falling and hope she doesn't actually fall, hope the recording works, hope someone watches, hope someone pays, hope the math finally works in their favor just this once, just enough, just long enough to buy time, to buy medication, to buy survival for another month until they have to do this again, until she has to fall again, until the recording becomes routine, becomes job, becomes who she is instead of what she does.

But that's future. That's speculation. That's catastrophizing about things that haven't happened yet. Tonight is just this one fall. This one recording. This one crossing of the threshold from safe content that doesn't sell to dangerous content that does.

Tonight is just survival. Just necessity. Just what has to happen for them to keep existing.

Simera releases Liz. Stands. Crosses to the table-door where the recording device sits. She picks it up. The weight is familiar now. The heft of it. The density. The way it presses against her palm like possibility, like danger, like the tool that will either save them or destroy her.

"I'm going to go now," Simera says. "Before dark. I want to do this while there's still light. While I can see. While the fear is honest instead of amplified by darkness."

"Okay."

"I'll have my phone. I'll text you when I get there. I'll text you when it's done. I'll text you when I'm coming home."

"Okay."

"I love you."

"I love you too." Liz's voice is barely audible. "So fucking much. More than I can say. More than I know how to say. Just—please be careful. Please come back."

"I will."

Simera pockets the device. Plugs the cable into the port behind her ear. The connection clicks home. Familiar. Intimate. The sensation of being complete, of being ready, of being prepared to record, to capture, to turn her experience into data into product into income into survival.

She leaves.

---

The building is twelve blocks away. Simera walks them, counting each one: one, two, three, four. Counting keeps her focused, keeps her from thinking about what she's about to do, keeps her from calculating all the ways this could fail, could hurt her, could kill her. The counting is meditative, automatic, the rhythm of numbers replacing the rhythm of anxiety, of terror, of the knowledge that in approximately forty-seven minutes she'll be standing on the edge of a building twenty-three stories high preparing to fall.

The neighborhood around the abandoned tower is industrial. Warehouses and distribution centers and businesses that closed decades ago, leaving behind shells of brick and broken windows and the particular emptiness of spaces that used to have purpose, used to have function, used to matter to someone before the economy shifted and the jobs left and the buildings remained as monuments to failure, to obsolescence, to the way capitalism abandons places the same way it abandons people.

The tower itself is gray concrete. Brutalist architecture from the seventies. Twenty-three stories of pure utility without ornamentation, without beauty, without any acknowledgment that buildings could be more than boxes to stack humans in. The ground floor windows are broken. The entrance is boarded up but someone has pried the boards loose—they hang at angles, nails half-pulled, wood rotting. Access is easy. Access is why people come here.

Simera counts: three pieces of graffiti visible from the street, two of them tags she doesn't recognize, one that says FALL in letters three feet high, dripping red paint that looks like blood, looks like warning, looks like invitation. The universe has a sense of humor. Or irony. Or the absolute indifference that Liz calls absurdism, that Liz says is the only honest response to existence, that Liz uses as philosophy and armor and the thing that keeps her laughing when everything else demands crying.

She enters.

The ground floor is gutted. Nothing remains except concrete pillars and the ghosts of walls, the outlines where cubicles used to be, where people used to sit in cheap office chairs doing cheap office work for cheap office wages, all of it pointless, all of it meaningless, all of it gone now, erased, as if it never happened, as if the forty years this building was operational meant nothing, changed nothing, left no mark except this empty space filled with trash and pigeons and the smell of decay.

The stairwell is in the back. Metal door hanging open. Darkness beyond. She turns on her phone's flashlight. The stairs are concrete, angular, ascending in squares that wind upward into the building's core. Graffiti covers the walls: tags, declarations, phone numbers, poetry, rage, the accumulated linguistic debris of everyone who came here before her, everyone who climbed these stairs for their own purposes, their own reasons, their own recordings or jumps or attempts to feel something, to prove something, to escape something.

One piece of graffiti makes her stop: _We jump because falling is the only freedom left._

Simera stares at it. The words are spray-painted in blue, the letters careful, deliberate, more art than vandalism, more philosophy than destruction. She doesn't know if she agrees. Doesn't know if falling is freedom or just another form of imprisonment, another way poverty makes you jump because staying still means dying anyway. Doesn't know if the person who wrote this survived their jump or if this is a suicide note disguised as philosophy, if this is celebration or despair or both simultaneously, indistinguishable.

She keeps climbing.

The stairs are endless. Twenty-three stories is two hundred and seventy-six stairs. She counts them. Has to count them. Can't not count them. Each step is one more step closer to the edge, one more step toward the moment when she'll have to choose to fall, have to commit to falling, have to record her own fear and sell it to strangers who will consume it and rate it and hopefully, hopefully pay enough that this is worth it, that this solves the problem, that this isn't just danger for danger's sake but danger for survival's sake.

Her legs burn. She's not in shape for this. Poverty doesn't leave much energy for exercise, for fitness, for maintaining a body that functions optimally. Poverty is about making the body function minimally, about doing just enough to survive, about conserving energy because energy is calories and calories are money and money is scarce. By the sixteenth floor she's breathing hard. By the twentieth she has to stop, rest, let her heart rate slow from frantic to merely elevated.

The phone in her pocket buzzes. A text from Liz: _You there yet?_

Simera types: _Almost. 3 more floors._

Liz: _Be safe. I love you._

Simera: _I love you too._

She pockets the phone. Climbs the last three floors. Forty-three stairs. She counts them.

The top floor is different from the others. Where the lower floors are gutted, stripped, reduced to concrete and air, the top floor still has remnants of what it was: broken office furniture pushed against walls, filing cabinets tipped over and spilling yellowed paper across the floor like snow, like ash, like the remains of burned documents that weren't important enough to save but existed anyway, marked someone's work, marked someone's life. The windows here are large, floor-to-ceiling glass, most of it broken, most of it gone, leaving gaps that open onto nothing, onto air, onto the city below spread out like a map of itself, like a diagram of survival and failure, of people living and dying in proximity without touching, without knowing each other, without mattering to each other.

Simera approaches one of the broken windows. The frame is empty. No glass remains. Just the opening. Just space. Just the twenty-three story drop to the ground below where concrete waits, patient, inevitable, ready to catch her if she actually falls, ready to end her if this goes wrong, if she misjudges, if fear makes her slip.

She stands at the edge. Looks down.

The ground is far. Very far. Farther than it seems on a map, farther than it seems in measurements, farther than her mind can fully process. Twenty-three stories translates to approximately two hundred and thirty feet. Two hundred and thirty feet translates to approximately seven seconds of freefall if she actually jumped, if she actually fell, if this recording became reality instead of just performed reality, if the device failed and she had nothing to catch her, no safety net, no mechanism of survival except the hope that she doesn't actually step off, doesn't actually lose her balance, doesn't actually do what she's pretending to do.

Her heart is hammering. One hundred and thirty-seven beats per minute. She counts them. Can feel each one like a drum, like an engine, like proof that she's alive, still alive, not falling yet, not dead yet, still standing here on solid concrete with a choice still available, a choice to turn around, to leave, to go back to Liz and the apartment and the poverty that's terrible but at least familiar, at least known, at least not this, not standing on the edge of a building preparing to perform falling, preparing to commodify her own terror, preparing to turn survival into content.

But turning around doesn't solve anything. Turning around leaves them with thirty-seven dollars and five pills and two weeks and drowning. Turning around means the walking tour was all she can do, means safe is the limit of her capability, means she's not brave enough or desperate enough or broken enough to do what the market demands, what the algorithm rewards, what top creators do to make real money, to escape poverty instead of just slightly delaying poverty's ultimate victory.

Simera pulls out the recording device. The screen glows: READY TO RECORD.

Her hands are shaking. Both of them. Tremors she can't control. Adrenaline. Fear. The body's reasonable response to standing at the edge of a fatal drop, preparing to perform a fall, preparing to trick her own brain into thinking she's dying so the recording captures authentic terror, authentic fear, the kind of intensity that consumers pay for, that makes falling Mementos so profitable, so popular, so addictive.

She thinks about the Memento from Chapter 1. The one she's consumed seven times. The hospital gown. The one hundred and fourteen floors. The kiss that built and built and never concluded, that cut at the moment before impact, that left her gasping and desperate and needing more. Someone created that. Some person stood on the edge of a building—higher than this, much higher than this—and recorded themselves falling and captured something so intense, so authentic, so real that people like Simera pay thirteen dollars to experience it, pay again and again because once isn't enough, because the intensity demands repetition, because that's what makes it profitable: not just that people watch, but that they watch repeatedly, that they consume the same death over and over, that they need it like a drug, like escape, like the only thing that makes them feel alive.

That creator probably made thousands of dollars from that single recording. Probably made enough that they don't have to stand on building edges anymore, don't have to risk death for survival, don't have to choose between safety and rent. That creator escaped. That creator solved the problem. That creator did what Simera is about to do except they did it first, did it better, did it high enough that it became legendary, became one of the top falling Mementos, became the thing people refer to when they talk about what good falling content looks like.

Simera wants that. Needs that. Needs this recording to work, to sell, to generate enough income that she can buy Liz's medication and pay some bills and breathe easier for a little while before they have to do this again, before the money runs out, before poverty reasserts itself and demands another fall, another recording, another crossing of a boundary she didn't think she could cross until she had to.

She checks her phone. Texts Liz: _About to record. I'm ok. Will text when done._

The response is immediate: _I love you. Be careful. Come back._

Simera pockets the phone. Takes a breath. Counts: one inhale, two seconds held, three seconds exhale. Again: one, two, three. Again. The counting settles her. Makes the terror manageable. Makes the impossible feel possible, the unbearable feel bearable, the about-to-happen feel like something she can survive.

She presses the button on the device.

The recording begins.

REC

The small red light. The pulse against her ribs. The knowledge that her consciousness is now being captured, encoded, turned into data. Everything she sees, feels, thinks, experiences from this moment forward is product. Is commodity. Is content that strangers will consume.

Simera stands at the edge for seventeen seconds. Counts them. One. Two. Three. Each second is a lifetime. Each heartbeat is a choice. Stay or retreat. Live or fall. Be brave or be safe. The recording captures all of it—the looking down, the seeing, the processing of distance that translates to death, the feeling of fear that isn't just an emotion but a total physical crisis, a body in revolt against what the mind is demanding it do.

The fear is real. That's important. The fear has to be real. Consumers can tell if you're faking, if the emotion is performed instead of experienced. The device records neural patterns—it captures not just what you see but what you feel, what your brain does when it processes danger, when it confronts mortality, when it stands at the edge of death and has to choose whether to step toward it or away from it. And her brain is doing everything: flooding with adrenaline, shutting down non-essential systems, focusing entirely on survival, on threat assessment, on the immediate and undeniable fact that one wrong move means ending, means the two hundred and thirty feet becoming acceleration becoming impact becoming nothing.

The fear is real. So real her hands are shaking, her heart is racing, her breath is shallow and rapid and insufficient, her body is screaming at her to step back, to get away from the edge, to choose life over death, safety over danger, poverty over obliteration. So real that she understands, finally, why people pay for this. Why she's paid for this. Because this fear—this pure, absolute, undiluted terror—is the only thing that feels completely real, completely honest, completely true in a world made of compromises and performances and lies.

But she doesn't step back.

She steps forward.

One foot on the narrow ledge outside the window frame. The ledge is maybe six inches wide—enough to stand on if you're balanced, if you're careful, if you don't panic, don't slip, don't make any mistakes because mistakes mean falling, mean dying, mean the recording becomes real instead of performed, becomes your actual death instead of your performed death.

The wind hits her immediately. It's strong. Stronger than she expected. Twenty-three stories up, the wind is a presence, a force, a thing with teeth and intention and the ability to push, to pull, to unbalance. It tears at her jacket, at her hair, fills her mouth when she gasps, makes her eyes water. The wind is cruel. The wind doesn't care. The wind is just physics, just air moving from high pressure to low pressure, just the atmosphere doing what atmosphere does, indifferent to whether she lives or dies, indifferent to whether this recording works, indifferent to everything except its own motion.

Simera looks down.

The mistake is immediate. The ground rushes up to meet her eyes—not actually moving, but her perception makes it move, makes it lurch, makes it feel closer than it is, makes the two hundred and thirty feet feel like two hundred and thirty inches, like she's already falling, like she's already gone over the edge even though she's still standing, still balanced, still alive, still choosing to be alive.

Her knees buckle. For a moment she thinks she's falling, thinks this is it, thinks the recording has become reality and she's about to die for real, about to hit the ground for real, about to end not as performance but as actual ending.

But her hand shoots out. Grabs the window frame. Holds on. Her knuckles go white with the pressure of holding, of not-falling, of choosing to stay balanced, to stay alive, to not let go.

She counts her heartbeats: one hundred and forty-nine, one hundred and fifty-two, one hundred and fifty-eight. They're accelerating. The fear is total now. Complete. She's never been this afraid. Never felt terror this pure, this absolute, this consuming. Every cell in her body is screaming. Every instinct is demanding she climb back inside, get away from the edge, choose safety, choose survival, choose the poverty she knows over the death she's performing.

But she doesn't climb back inside.

She lets go of the window frame.

Both hands out. Arms spread. Standing on the narrow ledge with nothing holding her, nothing supporting her except her own balance, her own ability to stay still, to not panic, to not let the fear make her move in ways that would be fatal.

The wind pushes. She leans into it. Finds equilibrium. Finds the point where wind and gravity and her own body weight balance each other, where she's neither falling forward nor falling backward, just existing on the edge between both, just suspended in the moment between safety and death, just being present in the terror and letting the device record it, letting the recording capture exactly how this feels—the physical sensations of wind and height and fear, the mental process of confronting mortality, the emotional experience of choosing to stay here, to not step back, to give the consumers what they're paying for: authentic terror, real fear, actual confrontation with death.

This is what they want. This is what sells. This is what makes falling Mementos profitable: not the fall itself, but the moment before the fall, the standing at the edge, the decision to jump, the terror and the anticipation and the awful knowledge that in a few seconds you'll be falling and there's no stopping it, no changing your mind, no safety net, just acceleration and air and the ground rushing up and the certainty of ending.

Simera stands there for forty-three seconds. Counts them. Forty-three seconds of pure terror, of absolute fear, of her body in crisis and her mind screaming and her consciousness being recorded, being captured, being turned into the product that strangers will pay thirteen dollars to experience, to consume, to live through without actually risking anything, without actually standing here, without actually choosing to stay on the edge instead of stepping back to safety.

Then she can't do it anymore.

She can't stay here. Can't sustain this. The fear is too much. Her body is demanding retreat, demanding safety, demanding she choose to survive instead of choosing to perform this impossible thing, this terrifying thing, this thing that's costing her everything to maintain.

She steps backward. Off the ledge. Back through the window frame. Onto solid concrete. Safe. Alive. Not falling. Not dead. Still here.

She collapses.

Sits on the floor with her back against the wall, breathing hard, shaking, crying without meaning to, tears streaming down her face as the adrenaline crash hits, as the terror that she was holding at bay while recording floods through her now that she's safe, now that she doesn't have to maintain the performance, now that she can just be herself reacting to what she just did, to how close she came, to how real the danger was.

The device is still recording. She let it capture the retreat, the collapse, the crying. She'll edit that out later. Consumers don't want the aftermath. They want the edge. They want the terror. They want the moment before, not the moment after. The aftermath is too human, too real, too honest about what this costs.

She presses the button. The recording stops.

RECORDING COMPLETE  
DURATION: 00:03:47  
FILE SIZE: 432MB  
READY TO UPLOAD

Three minutes and forty-seven seconds. Two hundred and twenty-seven seconds of standing at the edge, of being in terror, of performing fear that was real fear, of commodifying mortality for strangers to consume.

Is three minutes enough? Is it long enough? Will people pay for three minutes of edge-standing? Or will they want more—want the actual jump, want the fall, want her to have actually let go, actually fallen, actually given them the full experience instead of just the beginning of it?

But she can't. She can't actually jump. She doesn't have safety equipment. No harness. No rope. No net. Just her and the edge and the concrete below. Jumping would mean dying. Jumping would mean the recording captures her actual death and becomes evidence of suicide or becomes the most valuable content she ever creates because death is the ultimate intensity, the ultimate authentic experience, the thing that's impossible to fake, impossible to perform, impossible to survive and repeat.

But she needs to survive. Needs to repeat. Needs to do this again next month when the money runs out. Death is not a sustainable business model. Death is the end of content creation, the end of income, the end of helping Liz, the end of everything except the ultimate escape from poverty through obliteration.

So three minutes of edge-standing will have to be enough. Will have to sell. Will have to be what she can offer because it's all she can give without dying, all she can commodify without ending.

Simera sits on the floor for eleven minutes. Counts them. Lets her heart rate slow, lets her breathing normalize, lets the tears dry on her face and the shaking stop and the terror recede to manageable levels. She checks her phone: seven missed texts from Liz.

_Are you ok?_  
_Sim?_  
_Please answer_  
_I'm worried_  
_Please tell me you're ok_  
_Simera answer your fucking phone_  
_If you don't answer in two minutes I'm calling 911_

The timestamps show escalation. The first text came three minutes after she started recording. The last one came forty-two seconds ago. Simera types quickly: _I'm ok. Recording is done. Coming home. I'm safe. I love you._

The response is instant: _Thank fuck. I thought you died. I thought you fell. I thought I lost you._

Simera: _I'm ok. I promise. Coming home now._

She stands. Her legs are shaky but functional. She pockets the device. Leaves the abandoned floor, the broken windows, the edge where she stood and performed terror and didn't fall, didn't die, survived to record again, to do this again, to keep crossing lines she swore she'd never cross because survival demands it, because Liz's medication costs sixty-seven dollars, because five pills isn't enough, because thirty-seven dollars from the walking tour is nothing, is insulting, is the market telling her that safety is worthless, that only danger has value, that only terror sells.

The stairs down are easier than the stairs up. She counts them anyway: two hundred and seventy-six. Her legs tremble on some of them. Her heart is still elevated, still processing the adrenaline, still recovering from the crisis it just experienced, still believing on some level that she was dying, that the fall was real, that the recording was reality instead of performed reality.

But she survived. That's what matters. She stood at the edge and recorded herself and survived. She created content that will sell—has to sell, must sell, because if it doesn't sell then she'll have to do something more extreme, something more dangerous, something that risks more, that gives consumers even more intensity, even more authenticity, even more of whatever they're seeking when they buy falling Mementos, when they pay to experience someone else's confrontation with mortality.

She exits the building. The street is gray afternoon light, normal, mundane, nothing like the edge, nothing like the terror, nothing like the place she just was. The distance between the top floor and the ground floor is twenty-three stories, two hundred and seventy-six stairs, eleven minutes. But the distance between who she was when she entered the building and who she is now feels vaster, feels unbridgeable, feels like she's crossed something irreversible, become someone different, someone who stands on ledges and performs fear and sells terror to strangers.

She is a creator now. Really a creator. Not someone who recorded a walking tour that no one wanted. Someone who does what the market demands. Someone who gives consumers what they pay for. Someone brave enough or desperate enough or broken enough to stand at the edge and record herself almost dying so other people can experience almost dying without risking anything, without paying the cost that she's paying, without becoming what she's becoming.

Simera walks home. Counts the blocks: twelve. Counts the cracks in the sidewalk: more than before, or maybe she's just noticing them more, maybe confronting mortality makes you see fractures everywhere, makes you aware of how broken everything is, how close to collapse, how temporary. Counts the people she passes: twenty-three, the same number as the stories she stood above, the same number as the floors between her and death, the same number as all the moments where she chose to stay, chose to not jump, chose survival even though survival means doing this again.

The apartment is the same. Four walls. Twelve by nine paces. Nothing has changed. Everything has changed. She opens the door. Liz is there immediately—crosses the six paces between the mattress and the door in two seconds, pulls Simera into a hug so tight it hurts, holds on like if she lets go Simera will disappear, will dissolve, will turn out to have been a ghost all along, will turn out to have actually fallen, actually died, the texts were from a corpse, the survival was illusion.

"You're ok," Liz says into Simera's shoulder. "You're ok. You're here. You're real. You're not dead."

"I'm not dead."

"I was so scared. I thought—I thought I lost you. I thought the recording failed and you fell and I'd never know, I'd just wait here and you'd never come home and eventually someone would find your body and tell me and I'd have to process that the last thing I said to you was 'be careful' like that's enough, like that's adequate, like that means anything when you're standing on a ledge recording yourself almost dying."

"I'm ok. I'm here. I survived." Simera holds Liz back, counts: ten fingers gripping her jacket, two arms wrapped around her, one person who loves her, one person she came back for, one reason to not have jumped, to not have let go, to not have chosen the fall over the return. "I did it. I recorded it. Three minutes and forty-seven seconds of standing at the edge. It's done. It's over. I don't have to do it again until—" She stops. Can't finish the sentence. Until next time. Until the money runs out. Until they need more. Until the medication is gone and the bills are due and survival demands another edge, another performance, another confrontation with mortality for profit.

"Let me see," Liz says.

"See what?"

"The recording. I want to see it. I want to know what you did. What you experienced. What you sold."

"Liz—"

"I need to see it. I need to understand. I need to know what this costs you. What you're becoming. What I'm asking you to become by existing, by being in pain, by needing medication we can't afford. I need to witness what you're doing for us. Even if it hurts. Especially if it hurts."

Simera pulls out the device. The screen still shows: READY TO UPLOAD. But there's another option: PREVIEW. She's never used it. Never previewed her own content. The walking tour she uploaded without watching, without seeing what consumers saw, without knowing what she looked like as product, as commodity, as content.

But Liz is right. She should see it. Should know what she's selling. Should understand what consumers will experience, will pay for, will consume and rate and hopefully return for more.

She taps PREVIEW.

The screen expands. The device has a small display but it's enough. Enough to show the footage, to play back the recording, to let Simera see what she experienced from outside herself, from the consumer's perspective, from the point of view of people who will buy this and plug it into their own brains and live through what she lived through.

The recording begins.

And immediately Simera understands—viscerally, completely, devastatingly—why falling Mementos are so profitable.

Because watching it is one thing. Living through it was another. But seeing herself from outside, seeing what consumers will see, understanding what she looked like as product, as commodity, as content—that's something else entirely. That's the moment when the performance becomes real in a new way, when the self splits completely, when she's both the person who stood at that edge and the person watching that person stand there, both creator and consumer, both product and purchaser, both the thing being sold and the thing being bought.

The point of view is hers but also not-hers: looking down from the edge through eyes that are hers but that consumers will experience as their own, seeing the ground far below with vision that's hers but that strangers will inhabit, will possess, will use to experience her terror as if it's their terror, her fear as if it's their fear, her standing at the edge as if it's them standing there even though they're safe, even though they're just consuming, even though they risk nothing while she risked everything.

The frame shakes. Not much. Just slightly. Her trembling translated into visual instability, into movement that makes the viewer feel the fear viscerally, physically, in their own bodies even though those bodies are safe, are lying on beds or sitting in chairs, are nowhere near edges, nowhere near falling, nowhere near death. The shaking is involuntary—she couldn't control it when she was there, can't edit it out now even if she wanted to. The shaking is proof. Proof that the fear was real. Proof that she wasn't performing. Proof that she was actually terrified, actually risking something, actually standing at the edge of death and recording herself being there.

Three minutes and forty-seven seconds of pure tension. No relief. No resolution. No escape. Just standing at the edge, looking down, processing the height, the danger, the very real possibility of falling. The recording captures her elevated heart rate—one hundred and fifty-eight beats per minute at the peak, she can see the timestamp, can see the exact moment when terror became absolute, when her body believed completely that it was about to die. Consumers will feel their own hearts racing when they experience this. Their bodies will respond to her body's responses. Their fear will be her fear, borrowed, consumed, experienced secondhand but feeling firsthand, feeling real, feeling like they're the ones standing there even though they never stood anywhere except in front of a screen deciding whether to pay fifteen dollars to feel what she felt.

The recording captures her shallow breathing—seventeen breaths per minute when it should be twelve to sixteen, when anything above twenty is hyperventilation, when her body is taking in air but not processing it, not using it, just gasping because gasping is what bodies do when they think they're dying. Consumers will breathe shallow when they experience this. Will feel their own lungs struggling. Will feel their own bodies preparing for death even though death isn't coming, isn't real for them, is just data, just experience, just borrowed terror that they can end whenever they want by unplugging, by stopping the playback, by returning to safety.

The recording captures her terror. All of it. Every moment of it. The pure, undiluted, absolute fear of standing at the edge and looking down and choosing to stay there instead of stepping back to safety. Consumers will be terrified. That's what they're paying for. That's what makes this profitable. Not the performance of fear but the reality of it. Not someone pretending to be scared but someone actually scared, actually confronting mortality, actually standing at the edge of their own ending and recording it so strangers can experience ending without actually ending, can feel death without actually dying, can have the intensity without the consequence.

And they'll pay for it. They'll pay thirteen dollars or fifteen or twenty depending on how she prices it. They'll pay more than they paid for the walking tour. Much more. Because this isn't calming. This isn't nice. This isn't atmospheric content that helps them fall asleep. This is intensity. This is danger. This is what they're actually seeking when they open the app, when they search for falling Mementos, when they buy content from creators who are brave enough or desperate enough or broken enough to stand at edges and record themselves almost dying.

They'll pay to feel this fear without risking anything. They'll pay to confront mortality without actually confronting it. They'll pay to stand at the edge and look down and feel what she felt without having to actually be there, without having to actually choose whether to jump, without having to carry the cost of standing there, without having to become what she's becoming, without having to sell what she's selling, without having to cross the lines she's crossing.

The recording ends with her stepping backward. The retreat is visible for three seconds—the relief of solid ground, the safety of the interior, the fact of survival, the shaking intensifying as the adrenaline crashes, as the terror that she was holding at bay while performing floods through now that performance is over. She'll cut that part. Consumers don't want relief. They want sustained tension. They want the fear without the resolution. They want the edge without the safety. They want to stay in the terror because that's what they're paying for: intensity without consequence, fear without danger, the experience of almost dying without actually dying, without having to process the aftermath, without having to sit on a floor shaking and crying and understanding what they just did, what they just became, what they just sold.

"Jesus," Liz whispers. "That's—that's really intense, Sim. That's—" She can't finish. Her face is pale, bloodless, the color of someone who's seen something they can't unsee, can't unknow, can't reconcile with the person sitting next to them. Her hands are shaking—not slightly, not subtly, but violently, the way hands shake after trauma, after crisis, after witnessing something that breaks something inside you. Just from watching the preview, just from seeing what Simera experienced on a small screen without the neural immersion, without the full force of the terror, she's shaking, she's scared, she's understanding in a way she didn't before, couldn't before, what this costs. Not just the fear while standing there but the transformation, the becoming, the crossing of a line that doesn't just divide before and after but divides person from product, self from commodity, Simera from FreeFall_Creator.

"That's what sells," Simera says quietly. Her voice is flat. Empty. The voice of someone who's already calculating, already planning the next edge, already accepting that this is who she is now, what she does, how she survives. "That's what the market wants. That's what I have to give them."

"How much do you think you'll make?"

"I don't know. The forums say first falling Memento usually makes between two and five hundred dollars if it's good. More if it gets featured, if the algorithm picks it up, if it goes viral in creator circles. Less if no one watches. But falling content consistently performs better than safe content. Consistently generates more income. The math says this will work. Has to work. Must work."

Liz is quiet for a long time. Then: "Upload it. Let's see. Let's find out if this was worth it. If your terror is profitable. If standing at the edge of death generates the income we need to keep not-dying."

Simera opens the upload interface. The process is familiar now—she did this with the walking tour, learned the steps, understands the mechanics. But this feels different. This feels like uploading something that matters, something that cost her, something that will define whether she's viable as a creator, whether she's capable of doing what the market demands.

She fills in the fields:

**TITLE:** _Edge (Twenty-Three Stories)_

**DESCRIPTION:** _Standing at the edge of an abandoned building. Looking down. Feeling the wind. Confronting the fall. Three minutes of pure terror. No safety net. No performance. Just fear._

**CATEGORY:** Extreme Sports / Thrill & Danger

**DURATION:** 00:03:47

**PRICE:** $14.99

Fifteen dollars. Higher than most first falling Mementos. But the forums say confidence in pricing matters, that charging too little makes content seem low-quality, that consumers trust higher-priced content more because they assume price correlates with intensity, with quality, with authenticity. Fifteen dollars says: this is worth your money. This cost me something to create. This is premium terror.

**TAGS:** #falling #height #edge #terror #authentic #noharness #realfear #firstrecording

The tags are strategic. #falling and #height are high-traffic search terms. #authentic and #realfear signal to consumers that this isn't performed, isn't faked, isn't someone with safety equipment pretending to be scared. #noharness is risky—it admits she had no safety, which could make some consumers uncomfortable but will attract others, the ones who want maximum authenticity, who want to know the creator actually risked something. #firstrecording plays to the audience that likes discovery, that likes finding new creators, that likes the narrative of someone just starting out, just crossing the threshold, just becoming what they consume.

She reviews everything. Checks for errors. Finds none. Her thumb hovers over UPLOAD.

This is it. The moment when three minutes and forty-seven seconds of terror become product, become commodity, become content that strangers will buy. The moment when her fear becomes transaction, her mortality becomes merchandise, her survival becomes content creation strategy.

"Do it," Liz says quietly. "Upload it. Cross this line completely. Become what you need to become."

Simera taps UPLOAD.

The progress bar fills: 11%... 34%... 59%... 87%... 100%

UPLOAD COMPLETE  
YOUR MEMENTO IS NOW UNDER REVIEW  
APPROVAL TYPICALLY TAKES 1-3 HOURS  
YOU'LL BE NOTIFIED WHEN IT'S LIVE

One to three hours. Simera counts: sixty to one hundred and eighty minutes of waiting, of not knowing, of wondering if the review process will approve it or reject it, if they'll flag it for being too dangerous, for having no safety equipment, for depicting recklessness that could encourage other creators to take similar risks. Or if they'll approve it, feature it, push it to consumers who want exactly this, who are searching for exactly this intensity, this authenticity, this confrontation with mortality.

"Now we wait," Simera says.

"Now we wait," Liz echoes.

They sit together on the mattress. Liz's head on Simera's shoulder. Simera's arm around Liz. Two people in one room counting the minutes until they find out if terror is profitable, if fear generates income, if standing at the edge of death is worth enough money to buy medication, to pay bills, to buy time, to survive for another month until they have to do this again.

Simera counts: four walls, twelve by nine paces, five painkillers left, thirty-seven dollars from the walking tour, unknown dollars from the falling Memento, one to three hours until approval, one girlfriend beside her, one person she did this for, one person worth almost dying for, one reason to have stood at the edge and not jumped, to have recorded instead of fallen, to have chosen survival instead of ending.

One life. One choice. One fall recorded. One threshold crossed. One person she was. One person she's becoming. The distance between them feels vast, feels unbridgeable, feels like standing at the edge of a building looking at the ground below and knowing you have to jump but choosing to just record the looking, just capture the fear, just sell the moment before instead of the moment during, just commodify the edge instead of the fall itself.

For now.

For now the edge is enough. For now three minutes and forty-seven seconds of almost-falling is sufficient, is adequate, is what she can give without dying. For now she can be a creator who stands at edges instead of a creator who jumps off them.

But she knows—suspects, fears, can already feel it approaching like inevitability—that edges won't be enough forever. That eventually the market will demand more. The algorithm will push her further. Consumers will want the actual fall, not just the standing before it. Fifteen dollars will stop being enough. Three minutes will stop being sufficient. The edge will become routine, become boring, become just another safe thing that doesn't sell, that doesn't generate the income they need.

And when that happens, when the edge stops being enough, she'll have to jump. Really jump. Record herself actually falling, actually giving consumers the full experience, the complete arc from edge to ground, from safety to ending, from living to—

But that's future. That's catastrophizing. That's worrying about falls she hasn't taken yet, lines she hasn't crossed yet, versions of herself that don't exist yet.

Today she stood at the edge. Today she recorded terror. Today she survived. Today she uploaded content that might—might—generate enough income to buy Liz's medication, to keep them surviving, to postpone the next edge for another month.

Today is enough.

The approval notification arrives one hour and forty-three minutes later. Simera's phone buzzes. She's been checking it every forty-seven seconds for the entire wait, refreshing the creator portal, watching for the notification, unable to focus on anything else, unable to be present with Liz, unable to exist in the moment because the future is approaching in one to three hours and she can't stop counting the minutes until it arrives.

The notification reads:

CONGRATULATIONS!  
Your Memento "Edge (Twenty-Three Stories)" has been approved!  
It's now live on the platform and available for purchase.

Simera opens the creator portal. Her profile now shows: 2 Mementos Created. She clicks on the new one. The listing appears:

**EDGE (TWENTY-THREE STORIES)**

Duration: 3:47  
Price: $14.99  
Category: Extreme Sports / Thrill & Danger  
Rating: No reviews yet

Zero views. Zero purchases. Zero income. But it's only been live for forty-three seconds. She refreshes. Still zero. Refreshes again. Still zero.

"Stop," Liz says gently. "You'll drive yourself crazy. It takes time. People have to find it. The algorithm has to start recommending it. Reviews have to come in. Give it time."

"We don't have time. We have five pills. We have two weeks. We have bills due Friday."

"We have time for this to work. Just—breathe. Be patient. Trust the process."

Trust the process. The process is a machine that crushes people and occasionally, randomly, arbitrarily rewards some of them with income that's barely enough to survive, that's never enough to escape, that just keeps you grinding, keeps you creating, keeps you selling yourself piece by piece because each piece generates just enough money to necessitate selling another piece.

But she nods. Sets her phone down. Tries to be patient. Tries to trust. Tries to not count the seconds between refreshes, the minutes between views, the hours between upload and the first sale that will determine whether this worked, whether she's viable, whether she can be what the market demands.

Forty-seven minutes pass. Simera has refreshed the portal sixty-three times. She's counting. Can't stop counting.

On the sixty-fourth refresh, the numbers change.

Views: 3  
Purchases: 1  
Revenue: $14.99

One person. One stranger. One consumer who searched for falling content, found her Memento, bought it, is currently plugging the cable into their port, is currently starting the playback, is currently experiencing what she experienced, is currently standing at the edge through her consciousness, through her eyes, through her fear.

One sale. Fifteen dollars. The number is small but it's not zero. It's proof of concept. It's evidence that she can do this, that the market wants what she's selling, that standing at the edge is worth something to someone, that her terror has value.

She refreshes again. Views: 7. Purchases: 3. Revenue: $44.97.

Three people. Forty-five dollars. In seventeen minutes. The walking tour took seventeen hours to make thirty-seven dollars. This has made forty-five dollars in seventeen minutes.

"It's working," Simera whispers. "People are watching. People are buying. It's working."

Liz looks over her shoulder at the screen. "How much so far?"

"Forty-five dollars. Three sales. Still climbing."

"How much do you need?"

"To buy your medication? Sixty-seven dollars. To break even on equipment? Two hundred and forty. To feel safe? There's no amount. There's never enough. Money is temporary. Bills are permanent. We'll always need more."

Simera refreshes again. Views: 12. Purchases: 5. Revenue: $74.95.

Five sales. Seventy-five dollars. Enough for Liz's medication. Enough to buy back time, to buy back relief, to buy back the ability to exist without constant pain, to buy back the temporary postponement of suffering that medication provides.

"We can get your refill," Simera says. Her voice breaks. Relief or grief or both, she can't tell. "We can buy your painkillers. We can—" She can't finish. Starts crying. Not sad crying. Not happy crying. Just crying because she stood at the edge of a building and almost died and strangers are paying her for that and the money is enough, just barely enough, just sufficient for this one immediate need, and that's worth crying about, worth acknowledging, worth letting herself feel for a moment before the next need arrives, before the next bill comes due, before the next edge demands to be stood at.

Liz pulls her close. "You did it. You did the impossible thing. You stood at the edge and you recorded it and people wanted it and you made money and we can breathe easier for a little while. You did that. You."

"We did that. I did it for us."

"I know. And I hate that you had to. And I'm grateful that you did. And I'm scared of what comes next. And I love you. All of those things at once. All of them true simultaneously."

Simera keeps refreshing. The numbers keep climbing.

By midnight: 47 views, 23 purchases, $344.77 revenue.

By morning: 89 views, 41 purchases, $614.59 revenue.

By the end of the first week: 412 views, 187 purchases, $2,804.13 revenue.

Two thousand eight hundred and four dollars. From three minutes and forty-seven seconds of standing at an edge. From one afternoon of terror. From one recording of almost-dying.

The number is impossible. The number is life-changing. The number is more money than Simera has made in the past three months combined. The number is enough to buy Liz's medication. Enough to pay rent. Enough to pay some bills. Enough to eat food that isn't expired. Enough to breathe easier. Enough to make the terror worth it, to make the fear profitable, to make standing at the edge a rational economic decision instead of just desperation disguised as bravery.

The number is proof. Proof that she's viable. Proof that she can do this. Proof that the market wants what she's selling. Proof that she's valuable—not as a person, not as a human, but as a creator, as a producer of content, as someone who can generate experiences that others will pay for, that the algorithm will promote, that the platform will reward.

The number is also a trap. Because now she knows it works. Now she knows that standing at edges generates this much money. Now she knows what she's worth when she's terrified, when she's risking death, when she's performing mortality for profit. And knowing that—having that data, understanding those metrics—means she'll do it again. Has to do it again. Will be expected to do it again when the money runs out, when Liz's medication runs out, when the bills come due again, when poverty reasserts itself and demands another edge, another recording, another three minutes of terror for two thousand dollars.

The number is both salvation and prison. Both escape and cage. Both proof she can survive and proof she'll never stop having to do this, never stop having to stand at edges, never stop having to sell herself piece by piece until there's nothing left but the selling, until her identity becomes synonymous with content creation, until she can't tell anymore where Simera ends and FreeFall_Creator begins.

But today—this week—the number is victory. Small victory. Temporary victory. Victory that will have to be repeated and repeated and repeated until it stops being victory and becomes just routine, becomes just labor, becomes just the thing she does because it's the thing that works, the thing that pays, the thing that keeps them both alive even if alive starts meaning something different, something hollower, something that looks like survival but feels like dissolution, like the slow erosion of self in service of the market, in service of the algorithm, in service of survival that costs more than dying would have cost but at least provides the time to count the cost, to measure the price, to calculate exactly how much you've lost while congratulating yourself on still being here to do the math.

Simera reads the reviews. They arrive steadily throughout the week. Forty-seven reviews total. She counts them. Can't help but count them. The ratings average 4.6 stars. The comments are illuminating:

_Holy shit this is intense. My heart was racing the entire time. Best falling content I've experienced. 5/5_

_Really authentic fear. You can tell she's actually scared. Not performed. Real. 5/5_

_Too short. I wanted the actual fall. Just standing at the edge isn't enough. 3/5_

_Perfect length. The tension is incredible. Watching to see if she jumps. She doesn't but you don't know that until the end. 5/5_

_No harness? Are you crazy? This is dangerous and irresponsible. 2/5_

_No harness is exactly why this works. Maximum authenticity. She's actually risking something. More creators should be this brave. 5/5_

_Good but the angle is wrong. Should be looking down more. Should really emphasize the height. 4/5_

_FreeFall_Creator is going to be big. This is her first extreme content and it's already better than most established creators. Following for more. 5/5_

_When is the next one? Need more falling content from you. 5/5_

The comments are mixed but mostly positive. The criticism is constructive—viewers want more, want longer, want the actual fall instead of just the edge, want angles that emphasize height, want her to push further, harder, more extreme. The praise is validating—she's doing it right, she's authentic, she's brave, she's providing what they want even if they want more than she's giving.

And they want more. That's clear. Multiple comments asking for the next recording. Multiple people following her creator profile, subscribing for notifications, waiting for her to upload again. She has an audience now. Small but growing. Forty-seven people who watched and reviewed, probably two hundred more who watched but didn't review, some percentage of them who will watch again, who will check her profile regularly, who will pay for whatever she uploads next because they liked this, because they want more, because she's given them what they're seeking and now they expect her to keep providing it.

The algorithm has noticed too. Her Memento is getting featured in the "Trending in Extreme Sports" section. Getting recommended to users who watch similar content. Getting pushed by the platform because it's performing well, because engagement is high, because the metrics say this is quality content that consumers value, that should be shown to more consumers, that should be promoted and highlighted and used to attract more viewers which generates more revenue which keeps creators creating which keeps consumers consuming which keeps the platform profitable which keeps the machine running.

She's in the machine now. Fully in it. Not just participating but succeeding, not just creating but thriving, not just selling but being rewarded for selling, being told by the algorithm and the audience and the money itself that she's doing it right, that she's valuable, that she should keep going, keep creating, keep standing at edges and recording herself and turning terror into transaction.

And she will. She knows she will. Because the money is too good. Because Liz's medication costs sixty-seven dollars a month and rent is nine hundred and bills are four hundred and food is who-knows-how-much and the walking tour made thirty-seven dollars which is nothing, which is insulting, which is the market saying safe content is worthless. But standing at an edge for three minutes made two thousand eight hundred dollars which is everything, which is salvation, which is the market saying danger is valuable, terror is profitable, mortality is merchandise.

The math is clear. The path is obvious. The future is written in dollars and views and ratings that say: do more of this. Be more of this. Become more of this.

And she will.

Next month when the money runs out. Next time Liz needs medication. Next bill cycle. Next edge. Next recording. Next crossing of a threshold that gets easier each time, that becomes routine, that transforms from impossible to difficult to manageable to just what she does, just who she is, just FreeFall_Creator climbing buildings and standing at edges and recording terror for profit until the terror stops being terror and becomes just performance, becomes just labor, becomes just the job that pays enough to survive but costs more than surviving is worth.

But that's future. That's catastrophizing. That's worrying about falls she hasn't taken yet.

Today she has two thousand eight hundred dollars. Today Liz can get her medication. Today they can pay rent and some bills and eat food and breathe easier. Today the fall was worth it. Today the terror was profitable. Today she's FreeFall_Creator and it means something, it works, it saves them.

Today is enough.

Simera closes the creator portal. Sets her phone down. Lies back on the mattress beside Liz who's been watching her count, watching her refresh, watching her become someone new, someone successful, someone who makes money from fear, someone who's solved the problem even if solving it means becoming what you consume, means performing what you used to just experience, means crossing from victim to perpetrator, from exploited to exploiter, from the person being crushed by the machine to the person operating one of the machine's gears, still being crushed but at least crushing others too, at least extracting value from other people's desperation even as your own desperation is being extracted from.

"We did it," Simera whispers.

"You did it," Liz corrects.

"We. I did it for us. I stood at that edge for us. I recorded my terror for us. I sold myself for us. It's we. It's always we. Even when I'm alone on a building, even when I'm the only one standing there, it's still we because you're why I'm there, you're why I'm doing it, you're why I come back instead of jumping, you're why survival matters more than ending."

Liz takes her hand. "I know. And I'm grateful. And I'm terrified. And I love you. And I'm scared of what you're becoming. And I'm proud of what you did. All of it. All of those things. All at once."

They lie together in the one-room apartment that's the same as it was but also different because now they have money, now they have time, now they have postponement of the immediate crisis even though new crises are already forming, already approaching, already demanding to be addressed with more edges, more recordings, more terror for profit.

Simera counts: four walls that contain them, twelve by nine paces they share, one mattress they sleep on, two thousand eight hundred dollars they earned, one girlfriend she loves, one recording she survived, one threshold she crossed, one person she was before, one person she's becoming after, one life that's changing, one self that's dissolving, one identity that's becoming commodity, one future approaching that she can't see clearly yet but knows, suspects, fears will demand everything, will take everything, will turn her into nothing but content, but creator, but the person who stands at edges and records until there's nothing left except the standing, the recording, the performing of almost-dying that might one day become actual dying because the market demands it, because the algorithm pushes for it, because consumers want the full experience, because edges stop being enough and you have to jump, have to fall, have to give them everything including the ending, including yourself, including the final commodity that can only be sold once but sells for more than anything else because death is the ultimate authenticity, the ultimate content, the thing that can't be faked or performed or survived, the thing that makes you a legend, a creator whose work will be consumed forever because you gave them what no one else can give: your actual ending, your real death, your final fall.

But not today.

Today she's alive. Today she survived. Today she recorded the edge without falling off it. Today she's FreeFall_Creator who makes two thousand eight hundred dollars for three minutes of terror. Today she's successful, viable, valuable.

Today the numbers say: you're worth something. Your fear has value. Your terror generates income. Your mortality is merchandise.

Today the numbers say: keep going. Do more. Be more. Become what the market demands.

And she will. She knows she will. The first recording is always the hardest. The first edge is always the most terrifying. But edges become familiar. Terror becomes routine. Fear becomes just another thing you experience and record and sell, just another emotion to commodify, just another piece of yourself to package and upload and turn into dollars that buy medication, that buy time, that buy survival for another month until you have to do it again.

The numbers never lie. The numbers say she's a creator now. Really a creator. Successfully a creator. The kind who makes money, who gets reviews, who has an audience waiting for more.

The numbers say: this works. Keep doing it. You're good at it. You're profitable. You're valuable as long as you keep standing at edges, keep recording terror, keep giving us what we want, keep being what we need you to be: content. Commodity. Creator. The person who falls so others don't have to. The person who dies a little so others can experience dying without risking anything. The person who sells themselves so others can buy the experience of being sold.

The numbers say: you're FreeFall_Creator now. Not Simera who stands at edges. FreeFall_Creator who is edges, who is falling, who is content, who is product, who is whatever the market demands because the market pays and paying is surviving and surviving is everything even when everything costs too much, even when surviving means becoming someone else, someone unrecognizable, someone who looks in mirrors and sees a stranger staring back with dark eyes that have seen too many edges, too many drops, too many moments of almost-dying that add up to a slow death anyway, a dissolution so gradual you don't notice until you're gone, until there's nothing left but the performance, the content, the creator who creates because it's all they know how to do, all they are, all they've become.

But not today. Not yet. Not after just one recording. 

Today she's still mostly Simera. Still mostly herself. Still mostly the person Liz loves. The percentages are shifting—maybe she's seventy percent Simera now, thirty percent FreeFall_Creator—but mostly, mostly she's still who she was. Mostly she can still recognize herself in mirrors. Mostly she can still pretend this is just a job, just survival, just what she has to do instead of what she's becoming.

Tomorrow she might be someone else. Sixty percent Simera, forty percent creator. Fifty-fifty. The balance tipping. The self dissolving. Next recording. Next edge. Next crossing of a line that moves every time you cross it, that keeps demanding more, keeps requiring further, keeps insisting you become what you consume until consumer and creator are indistinguishable, until you're both simultaneously, until you're neither, until you're just part of the machine that grinds people down and extracts value from the grinding, until you're just FreeFall_Creator and Simera is a name you used to have, a person you used to be, a self you sold so completely that nothing remains except the performance, the content, the numbers that say you're valuable as long as you keep selling.

But today she's alive. Today she's here. Today she has two thousand eight hundred dollars and Liz beside her counting the same things she's counting: one girlfriend, one recording survived, one threshold crossed, one future approaching that neither of them can see clearly but both of them can feel—dark, vast, inevitable, like standing at the edge of a building and looking down and knowing you're going to jump eventually, knowing the edge won't be enough forever, knowing that what starts as performance eventually becomes reality, becomes identity, becomes the only thing you know how to be.

Today the numbers say: you did it. You survived. You succeeded. You're FreeFall_Creator.

And tomorrow the numbers will say: do it again.

And she will.

Because what else is there? What other choice exists? What path remains except the one she's started down, the one that's already carrying her forward like gravity, like falling, like the inevitable descent from edge to ground, from person to product, from Simera to FreeFall_Creator to whoever, whatever, she becomes when there's nothing left to sell except the final fall, the actual ending, the ultimate commodity?

The numbers never lie. They just don't tell you what it costs to believe them.

They don't tell you that two thousand eight hundred dollars buys one month of survival but costs one piece of yourself. That success at selling yourself means becoming sellable, means being seen as sellable, means seeing yourself as sellable until you can't remember what it felt like to be something other than commodity, other than content, other than the product that consumers rate three-point-five or four-point-six stars. That profitable terror means profitable you means your terror is your value is your worth is the only thing about you that matters to anyone including eventually yourself. That the first recording is always the hardest and the last recording might be the one where you finally, actually fall, finally give them what they really want, finally become the content instead of the creator, finally stop performing death and just die, just end, just give them the ultimate authenticity that can only be sold once but sells forever, that makes you legendary, that makes you the creator other creators reference when they talk about going all the way, about giving everything, about the cost of being truly, completely authentic.

The numbers don't tell you that. They just say: $2,804.13. Success. Do it again.

And she will.

God help her, she will. Because gods don't help people like her, people who stand at edges for money, people who sell themselves piece by piece and call it survival, people who become what they never wanted to become and call it necessary, call it logical, call it the only choice when what they really mean is the only choice poverty left them after taking all the others, after closing all the doors, after making edges the only option, falling the only path, dissolution the only destination.

She will do it again. And again. And again. Until the edges aren't enough. Until consumers want more. Until the algorithm demands more. Until she has to jump. Really jump. Give them the fall. Give them the ending. Give them herself completely, finally, utterly.

But not today.

Today she's still here. Still mostly herself. Still mostly Simera who loves Liz who counts ceiling cracks who stands at edges but doesn't jump, who records but doesn't fall, who sells herself but keeps just enough back that she can still call it herself, can still pretend there's something left that isn't for sale, isn't commodity, isn't content.

Today that's enough.

Tomorrow.

But not today.

Today she closes her eyes and counts: one girlfriend, one apartment, one recording survived, one threshold crossed, one person she's been, one person she's becoming, and the distance between them growing, widening, becoming unbridgeable until one day she'll look back and won't be able to see who she was anymore, won't be able to remember what it felt like to be Simera instead of FreeFall_Creator, won't be able to distinguish between performing life and living it, between selling herself and being herself, between the content and the creator, between the product and the person.

One day. But not today.

Today she's still counting. Still here. Still alive. Still mostly herself.

That has to be enough.

It has to be.
