# Chapter 16: The Trying

## Chapter Summary
Simera starts her new job. Customer service, remote work, mundane but legitimate. She struggles—her mind is worse than she realized. The fragmentation from months of Memento use, the cravings, the counting (OCD spiraling), the difficulty focusing. Reality feels less solid. But she keeps trying. She forces herself through each shift, telling herself this is what recovery looks like—hard, grinding, painful but necessary. Meanwhile, Liz can't seem to find work. She applies, interviews, but nothing comes through. Her chronic pain makes many positions impossible. The rejections pile up. The role reversal is subtle but present: Simera is the one working now, Liz is home, struggling, isolated. One night, they try to connect physically. A sex scene that should be intimate but reveals how damaged they both are. They go through the motions. Liz seems present at first, maybe even reaches orgasm, but there's a numbness to it—even in pleasure, she seems disconnected, empty. Simera notices but says nothing. Both of them feel it: something fundamental is broken in both of them. Normal pleasure, normal intimacy, normal life—none of it reaches them anymore. After, they hold each other in the silence of mutual damage. The next day, Simera comes home from work exhausted. She finds Liz on the bed, device plugged in, experiencing a Memento. Not a peaceful one—the screen shows it's hardcore, intense, possibly dangerous content. Simera stands there, seeing Liz caught, seeing the promise broken, seeing everything falling apart. The chapter ends with that discovery.

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Working, struggling with mental damage, trying to recover, noticing they're both broken, discovering Liz's relapse
- **Liz**: Unable to find work, isolated, using Mementos again, numb even to pleasure, caught by Simera

## Themes to Explore
- The lies addicts tell
- How we see what we want to see
- Trust misplaced
- Secret addiction
- Escalation in isolation
- The danger of using alone
- How hope blinds us
- The elaborate deception addiction requires

## Atmosphere & Tone
Grinding effort and struggle. Simera's work scenes should feel exhausting, her mental state deteriorating despite her efforts. The sex scene should be profoundly sad—physical intimacy revealing emotional/psychological damage in both of them. The mutual numbness should be devastating. The discovery at the end should feel like everything collapsing. Tragic, exhausted, broken.

## Writing Notes
- Show Simera's work struggle in detail
- Her mental fragmentation making simple tasks hard
- The counting, the reality blurring, the effort required
- She's trying but the damage is already deep
- Liz's job search failures should feel real
- The chronic pain limiting her options
- The isolation of being home alone
- **The sex scene is crucial**:
  - SHOW, don't tell the numbness in both
  - Liz's physical response but emotional absence
  - Even orgasm feels empty to her
  - Both going through motions
  - The sadness of broken intimacy
  - Neither acknowledging it aloud
  - The silence after says everything
- The discovery should be immediate and devastating
- Simera coming home, finding Liz using
- The hardcore content visible on screen
- Both frozen in that moment
- This directly sets up Chapter 17's confrontation
- Make the reader feel the tragedy of the attempt at normal life
- They tried so hard and it wasn't enough
