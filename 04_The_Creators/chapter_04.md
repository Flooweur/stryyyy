# Chapter 4: The Creators

The job rejection comes on Monday, three days after the interview, delivered via email at 6:47 AM. Simera is awake when it arrives—has been awake for two hours already, counting ceiling cracks in the gray pre-dawn light, counting the minutes until the phone might ring, counting the ways they might survive if it doesn't. The email is brief, professional, the kind of form letter that's been sent to thousands of other desperate people, that contains no individual recognition of her personhood, her need, her humanity. Just: _Thank you for your interest. We've decided to move forward with other candidates. We wish you the best in your job search._

The best. As if the best is something available to her. As if wishes cost nothing and mean nothing and change nothing.

She counts the words in the email: forty-three. Counts the sentences: five. Counts the number of times she reads it before the truth sinks in, before the math recalculates itself, before the future reshapes itself around this new data point: seven times. On the eighth reading, she deletes it. The deletion doesn't change anything. The job is still gone. The money is still absent. The bills are still unpaid. The future is still approaching like the ground after a fall, inevitable and fast and absolutely unforgiving.

"Sim?" Liz's voice from the mattress, thick with sleep and pain. "What time is it?"

"Early."

"You okay?"

"No."

"The job?"

"Yeah."

Liz doesn't say anything for a long time. Doesn't offer false comfort, doesn't pretend it's not a disaster, doesn't diminish the scope of the problem they're facing. This is what Simera loves about her—the refusal to lie when lying would be easier, would be kinder, would make them both feel better for approximately thirty seconds before reality reasserted itself. Liz deals in truth. It's her currency, her philosophy, her way of being in an absurd world that demands you either laugh at the meaninglessness or let it crush you. Even when truth is cruel. Especially then.

"We'll figure something out," Liz says finally. Not _it'll be okay_. Not _don't worry_. Just the acknowledgment that they'll keep trying, keep figuring, keep surviving because the alternative is unthinkable, is unspeakable, is the thing they both know is approaching but refuse to name.

Simera nods even though Liz can't see her in the dark. Counts: four walls, twelve by nine paces, seventeen bills, three red, eight remaining painkillers, zero job prospects, one decision she's been avoiding, one path she's been refusing to acknowledge, one solution she's been pretending doesn't exist.

One.

Always one.

The loneliest number. The most desperate number. The only number left.

---

By noon, Simera has applied to fourteen jobs. She counts them: three retail positions, four food service, two warehouse work, three cleaning services, two overnight security guard positions. All minimum wage. All desperate. All requiring her to pretend she wants to work there, wants to contribute, wants to be part of their team when what she actually wants is to survive, to eat, to not be evicted, to afford Liz's medication, to not drown. But wanting to survive isn't the right answer. The right answer is that she's passionate about restocking shelves at 2 AM, that she's excited about scrubbing toilets in office buildings, that her dream is to stand at a cash register for eight hours saying _thank you for shopping with us_ to people who don't see her, don't acknowledge her, treat her like a machine that accepts money and dispenses receipt.

The dishonesty exhausts her more than the work would. The performance of wanting. The theater of enthusiasm. The endless audition for the right to keep breathing.

Her phone buzzes. Not a job offer. A notification from the Memento app:

**NEW CREATOR SPOTLIGHT**
Meet AshFall_Creator: From broke to $18K/month
Watch her story →

Simera stares at the notification. She's seen these before. Has scrolled past them a hundred times, a thousand times, refusing to engage, refusing to acknowledge them as anything other than advertisements, propaganda, lies designed to lure desperate people into doing degrading things for money. But today, with the job rejection still fresh, with the bills still unpaid, with Liz still in pain and getting thinner and the future still approaching like an ending, today the notification looks different. Looks possible. Looks like information she needs.

She taps it.

The video loads. Full screen. High production value. The kind of polish that suggests success, suggests money, suggests that the person in this video has figured out something that Simera hasn't, has solved the problem that's destroying her, has found the exit from poverty that everyone promises exists but no one ever seems to find.

A woman appears on screen. Mid-twenties, Asian—Simera notices this immediately, feels something twist in her chest, recognition or desire or the sickening awareness that she's being targeted, that the algorithm knows exactly what she wants before she wants it, knows her better than she knows herself. The woman is beautiful in a way that's both natural and carefully constructed—minimal makeup but strategically applied, casual clothes that fit perfectly, hair that looks effortless but probably took an hour to style. She's standing in what appears to be a loft apartment: exposed brick walls, huge windows flooding the space with natural light, minimalist furniture that costs more than three months of Simera's rent. The floor is real hardwood, not laminate, not the kind of fake wood that poor people settle for. Real. Expensive. The kind of flooring that announces you've made it, you've escaped, you're no longer counting every dollar because dollars aren't scarce anymore, aren't precious, are just a tool you use to build the life you want.

"Hey everyone, I'm Ash," the woman says. Her voice is confident, warm, practiced. The voice of someone who knows they're being watched and likes it, who has learned to perform their life for an audience. "Two years ago, I was exactly where you are. Broke. Desperate. Working three jobs and still not making rent. I was drowning." She sits on a designer couch—leather, black, the kind you see in magazines. "Then I discovered Memento creation. And everything changed."

The video cuts to what must be earlier footage: Ash in a different apartment. Small. Cramped. The kind of space that Simera recognizes immediately—the one-room poverty box, the walls-closing-in cage that makes every day feel like suffocation. It could be Simera's apartment. Could be any poor person's apartment. They're all the same, really—same cracked walls, same desperate energy, same smell of failure that seeps into everything you own, everything you are. Ash looks different here: thinner, tired, the exhaustion visible in her posture, in her eyes, in the way she holds herself like someone who's given up but keeps going anyway because what else is there? Simera sees herself in that footage. Sees her present in Ash's past. Sees what she is now reflected in what Ash was then.

"I started small," Ash's voice continues over the old footage. "Just basic experiences. Walking through markets. Trying street food. Normal stuff. I made maybe two hundred dollars my first month. Barely covered groceries. But I kept at it." 

The video cuts back to current Ash in her expensive apartment. "Then I learned what the market actually wants. What people are willing to pay for. And I'll be honest—it's not the safe stuff. It's not the vanilla experiences. People want intensity. They want risk. They want what they're too afraid to do themselves. So I started giving it to them."

New footage: Ash climbing a building exterior, no safety equipment visible. Ash diving off a cliff into water. Ash in what looks like an underground club, surrounded by strangers, the lighting strobing, the crowd pressing in. Ash doing things that are dangerous, that are thrilling, that make Simera's pulse quicken just watching them, imagining them, thinking about what it would feel like to experience those moments, to live them, to be brave enough or desperate enough or broken enough to record them.

"Within six months, I was making more than all three of my jobs combined. Within a year, I quit them. Now?" Ash gestures at the apartment, the space, the life she's built. "I make my own schedule. I create content I'm interested in. I live exactly the life I want. And I get paid—really, actually paid—for experiences I'd probably have anyway. For being brave. For being willing to do what other people won't."

The video cuts to statistics:
- AshFall_Creator Monthly Earnings: $18,347
- Total Mementos Created: 127
- Average Rating: 4.8/5 stars
- Subscriber Count: 34,829

Thirty-four thousand people. Thirty-four thousand subscribers who pay to experience what Ash experiences, who consume her life, who want to be her or live through her or escape into her body for the duration of a recording. Thirty-four thousand people generating eighteen thousand dollars a month, which is more money than Simera has made in the last year combined, which is enough money to solve every problem she has, which is enough money to make poverty a memory instead of a prison.

"The platform makes it easy," Ash continues. "Heri handles everything—payment processing, distribution, quality control. You just live your life, record the interesting parts, upload them. That's it. That's the whole job. And yeah, some people will judge you. Some people will say you're selling out or degrading yourself or whatever. But you know what? Those people aren't paying my bills. They aren't solving my problems. They're sitting in their comfortable lives telling me what I should do with mine. And I stopped listening to them."

The video cuts to a montage: Ash at expensive restaurants, Ash traveling to beautiful locations, Ash buying things—clothes, electronics, art. The images are designed to seduce, to make you want what she has, to make you believe that this is achievable, that the distance between her life and your life is just one decision, just one choice, just one step off the edge into a fall that might save you instead of breaking you.

"If you're watching this and you're struggling," Ash says, looking directly at the camera, directly at Simera, like she can see through the screen into this cramped apartment, into this poverty, into this desperation, "you already have what you need. You just need to be brave enough to use it. Your experiences are valuable. Your willingness to take risks is valuable. Your life is valuable. Not as something to just endure, but as something to monetize, to share, to turn into the resource that gets you out of whatever situation you're in."

The video ends with a call to action:

**BECOME A CREATOR TODAY**
Sign-up bonus: $200 for your first upload
Average earnings: $4,700/month
Top 10% earnings: $15,000+/month

**START NOW →**

Simera watches the video again. And again. Five times total. Counts the number of times Ash says "brave": four. Counts the number of times she says "valuable": three. Counts the number of transitions between poor Ash and rich Ash: seven. The repetition makes the transformation seem natural, inevitable, just a progression of time and choice and willingness to do what needs to be done.

She opens a new tab. Types: "Memento creator earnings real"

The search returns hundreds of results. Forums where creators discuss their income, their experiences, their strategies. Articles analyzing the creator economy, the market dynamics, the way Heri's algorithm pushes certain content, rewards certain behaviors. Videos from other creators—some successful, some struggling, all of them claiming that it's possible, that it works, that if you're willing to push boundaries, to take risks, to give the market what it wants, you can make real money, enough money to escape, enough money to survive, enough money to stop drowning.

She opens a forum thread: "How much can you really make?"

The responses are mixed but mostly optimistic. People sharing their earnings, their niches, their advice:

_Started three months ago, I'm at $800/month. Not enough to live on yet but getting there. The key is finding your niche and pushing it._

_I make about $5K/month now. Took six months to build up. I do extreme sports—parkour, base jumping, free climbing. High risk but high reward. The algo loves danger._

_Honest take: if you're willing to do sexual content, you'll make money fast. I was struggling until I started doing intimate experiences. Now I'm at $12K/month. Is it degrading? Maybe. Does it pay my rent? Definitely._

_The black market pays better than Heri but it's riskier. I won't say what I do but I make $20K+ some months. You have to be willing to cross lines. But if you're desperate enough, lines start to look pretty arbitrary._

Simera reads for two hours. Twenty-seven different threads. Forty-nine creator testimonials. Hundreds of comments from people who have turned their lives, their bodies, their willingness to be hurt or scared or degraded into income. The pattern is clear: the more extreme the content, the more money it makes. The more dangerous, the more sexual, the more depraved, the higher the reward. The market has spoken. The algorithm has learned. It knows what people want, what they'll pay for, what they're desperate enough to consume.

It knows because Simera is one of them. She's the market. She's the consumer who pays for falling and fucking, for terror and intimacy, for experiences that make her feel alive when her actual life feels like a slow death. She's created the demand that these creators are supplying. She's the reason they're making money. She's the reason the algorithm pushes toward extremity, toward danger, toward the edge and over it.

She's been funding her own exploitation. Been paying other people to do what she could do herself. Been the victim when she could be the victimizer, the consumer when she could be the creator, the person being used when she could be the person doing the using.

The realization sits in her chest like a stone. Heavy. Undeniable.

Another notification. A different creator:

**FEATURED: DangerZone_Creator**
"I jumped off buildings so you don't have to"
$22K last month
Watch success story →

Simera clicks. Another video. Another transformation story. This creator is male, young, reckless in a way that reads as brave, that markets itself as courage even though it's probably just desperation repackaged. He talks about his first falling Memento—a twenty-story building, terrified, almost backed out but didn't because he needed the money. Made eight hundred dollars from that first upload. Did it again. Made twelve hundred. Built an audience. Now he does it regularly. Has developed a tolerance for the fear. Says it's like any other job—scary at first, routine after a while. Says the money makes it worth it. Says he's thinking about going higher, doing more extreme falls, maybe getting into BASE jumping, maybe pushing further because that's what the market wants, that's what the algorithm rewards, that's what the top creators do—they keep pushing, keep escalating, keep finding the edge and stepping past it because the edge is where the money lives.

Simera thinks about the falling Memento from Chapter 1. The hospital gown. The one hundred and fourteen floors. The wind like a kiss that built to something beyond pleasure, beyond terror, to some synthesis of both that had no name, no language, no way to describe it except as the most real thing she'd ever felt. The face in the puddle that wasn't hers, the stranger's face, dark eyes that had seen death and recorded it. That was someone. Some creator. Someone who recorded themselves jumping off a building and almost dying so that people like Simera could pay to experience it, could consume their terror, could live through their ending and wake up safe. Someone who turned their willingness to die into rent money. Someone who monetized their mortality.

That person made money from her fear. Made money from her willingness to risk death. Made money from being brave or broken or desperate enough to do what Simera is too scared to do, what most people are too scared to do.

Except maybe Simera isn't too scared anymore. Maybe desperation is a better teacher than fear. Maybe when you're drowning, you stop calculating the risks of swimming and just start moving, just start trying anything that might keep you above water, that might get you to shore, that might save you even if the method of saving looks like the thing that could kill you.

She opens a new tab. Types: "what types of mementos sell best"

More forums. More discussions. More creators sharing their analytics, their strategies, their understanding of the market:

_Falling content always sells. People are obsessed with it. If you can handle heights, that's your goldmine right there._

_Sexual content is the most reliable. Specifically if you fit certain demographics—Asian women make the most, statistically. The market is racist as fuck but it is what it is. If you've got what people want, use it._

_Danger + sex combo is top tier. Like, risky public encounters, that kind of thing. It combines two high-value categories. I make $8K/month doing just that._

_The black market pays double what Heri does but you have to be willing to create illegal content. Violence, drug use, really fucked up stuff. I know a creator who makes $40K/month doing murder fantasies. Actual recorded murders that look real enough that consumers can't tell the difference. Is it ethical? No. Does it pay? Extremely._

Simera counts: thirty-seven comments about sexual content, twenty-two about danger, fifteen about the black market, eight about violence, three about death. The numbers tell a story. The story is: everything is for sale. Every experience. Every risk. Every boundary you're willing to cross. Every part of yourself you're willing to commodify, to marketize, to turn into content that desperate people will consume because they're desperate in different ways, because they need escape just like you need money, because everyone is either selling or buying and the only question is which side you're on, which role you're playing, which position in the machine of exploitation you occupy.

She thinks about her Memento preferences. Falling. Sexual encounters with Asian women. The two categories that sell best. The two things the market wants most. The two things she already consumes, already pays for, already knows people will buy because she's one of them, she's the proof of concept, she's the guaranteed audience.

She could create what she consumes. Could be what she desires. Could turn herself into the product she already knows has a market because she is the market, she's the customer, she's the demand that proves supply is profitable.

The math is simple. It's always been simple.

"Sim?" Liz's voice from the mattress. "You've been on your phone for three hours. What are you looking at?"

Simera locks her phone. Turns. Liz is sitting up, looking at her with that expression—concerned, knowing, the look of someone who can see what you're thinking before you say it, who knows what you're going to do before you do it, who recognizes the shape of a decision forming like recognizing the shape of a storm forming on the horizon, inevitable and destructive and absolutely coming whether you're ready or not.

"Research," Simera says.

"What kind of research?"

The apartment is quiet. Four walls. Twelve by nine paces. Seventeen unpaid bills. Three red. Zero job offers. One decision. One conversation that's been delayed but can't be delayed anymore, can't be avoided anymore, has to happen because the math has been done and the numbers only work one way.

"About creating Mementos," Simera says.

Liz doesn't react immediately. Just looks at her. Simera counts the seconds: four, five, six, seven. Finally: "Okay."

"Okay?"

"Okay. Tell me what you found."

Simera takes a breath. Counts it: one deep inhale, hold for two seconds, exhale for three. "People make real money doing it. Like, actual livable money. There's a woman who makes eighteen thousand a month. There are creators averaging four or five thousand. Even people just starting out make hundreds."

"And you want to try it."

Not a question. A statement. An acknowledgment of what they both already know, what's been building since Chapter 3, since the bills turned red, since they started drowning, since survival became more important than dignity, more urgent than principle, more necessary than anything except continuing to breathe.

"I think I have to," Simera says.

Liz is quiet again. Then: "What kind of content?"

"The kind that sells. Falling Mementos. They're very popular. I—" She hesitates. The next part is harder to say, harder to admit, harder to acknowledge out loud even though they both know, have probably both known for months, years, maybe since the beginning. "I fit certain demographics that the market wants. Asian women. Sexual content. I could—"

"No." Liz's voice is sharp. Then softer: "I mean, you can. Obviously you can. It's your body. Your choice. Your life. But I need you to know what you're saying. What you're proposing."

"I know what I'm proposing."

"Do you? Because it sounds like you're talking about prostitution."

"It's not prostitution. It's recording experiences—"

"That are sexual. That you're selling. That people pay for. How is that different?"

Simera counts: four walls, twelve by nine paces, eight remaining painkillers for Liz, zero solutions to their poverty, one argument they were always going to have, one truth they're finally speaking. "The difference is that it pays more. The difference is that it pays enough. The difference is that we're about to be evicted and you're running out of medication and I just got rejected from another minimum-wage job and this is the only option left that actually works, that actually solves our problems, that actually gets us out of this."

"It's not the only option."

"What's the other option?"

Liz doesn't answer. Can't answer. Because they've been looking for other options for months and there aren't any, there never were, the system is designed to not have options, to close every exit except the ones that require you to sell yourself, to commodify yourself, to turn yourself into a product because that's what capitalism does—it takes people who are desperate and says the only way out is through exploitation, the only path to survival is through self-degradation, the only choice is to become the thing you consume or die trying to find another way that doesn't exist.

"I'm not judging you," Liz says finally. "I want you to know that. I'm not going to judge you for this. But I need you to know what it costs. I need you to think about what this does to you, to us, to—"

"To what? Our relationship? Our dignity? Our principles?" Simera hears her voice rising, cracking, breaking like something that was already broken just waiting for the right pressure to shatter completely. "Liz, we don't have the luxury of principles anymore. Principles are for people who can afford them. We can't afford food. We can't afford your medication. We can't afford to keep living like this, pretending that something will change, that some job will appear, that the math will suddenly work in our favor when it's been working against us since the beginning, since we were born into a system designed to keep people like us at the bottom, designed to give us no options except the degrading ones, designed to make us choose between surviving and maintaining dignity as if those things aren't fundamentally connected, as if you can have dignity without survival, as if you can maintain your principles while you're starving."

She's breathing hard. Didn't mean to yell. Didn't mean to let the anger out, the frustration, the accumulated rage of months of trying and failing and watching Liz get thinner and counting bills they can't pay and applying to jobs that don't want her and consuming Mementos they can't afford while the creators get rich off her desperation, get paid for her need, profit from the system that's crushing her.

Liz's face is unreadable. Then: "You're right."

"What?"

"You're right. About all of it. About the system. About the options. About the fact that principles are luxuries we can't afford." Liz stands, moves to the table-door, sits. Gestures for Simera to join her. "But you're wrong about one thing. You're wrong if you think I'm going to judge you. You're wrong if you think I don't understand why you're considering this. I do understand. I've understood for a while now. I've been waiting for you to say it out loud."

Simera sits across from her. The door-table between them. The bills stacked at one end like a cairn, like a monument, like a tomb marker for the life they thought they'd have, the future they thought they'd build, the people they thought they'd be. Everything they'll never become as long as they're drowning.

"You knew?" Simera asks.

"I've seen you looking at the creator ads. I've seen you reading the forums. I know what Mementos you buy, Sim." Liz's voice is gentle but unflinching. "I know your preferences. I've always known. And I've been watching you do the math in your head, calculating whether you could do what they do, whether you could be what the market wants. I've been waiting for you to decide. To commit. To stop pretending there are other options and acknowledge the only option that actually exists."

"And you're okay with it?"

Liz looks at her for a long time. Her face shows the pain—not physical pain, though that's there too, always there, but emotional pain, the pain of watching someone you love choose something that will hurt them because not choosing would hurt more, the pain of understanding why they have to do it while wishing they didn't, the pain of being powerless to change the system that's forcing the choice, that's requiring the sacrifice, that's demanding the price.

"No," Liz says quietly. "I'm not okay with it. But I understand it. And I'm not going to stop you. Because you're right—we don't have other options. We're drowning. And if this is how you survive, if this is how we survive, then I'm not going to judge you for choosing survival. I'm just going to be here. I'm going to watch you do this. I'm going to support you in whatever way I can. And I'm going to hope—" Her voice catches, breaks, and for a moment the facade drops and Simera sees the fear underneath, the terror, the knowledge that they're stepping off a cliff together and neither of them knows if they'll land or just keep falling forever. "And I'm going to hope that it doesn't destroy you. That it doesn't destroy us. That the cost of surviving doesn't end up being more expensive than drowning would have been."

Simera reaches across the table-door. Takes Liz's hand. Counts: ten fingers, two hands, one girlfriend, one decision, one fall she's about to take, one price she's about to pay, one hope that it will be worth it, that the math will finally work, that selling herself piece by piece will be enough to buy survival, to buy medication, to buy time, to buy a future that doesn't look like drowning.

"I'm scared," Simera says.

"I know."

"But I'm going to do it anyway."

"I know."

"What if it changes me? What if I become someone else? What if—"

"Then I'll love someone else. Then I'll figure out who you're becoming and love that person too. That's what this is, Sim. That's what love is. Not loving you when you're easy to love but loving you when you're hard to love, when you're changing, when you're doing things that scare both of us because the alternative is worse. I'll love you through this. Whatever this becomes. Whoever you become. I promise."

The promise sits between them. Simera wants to believe it. Wants to believe that love is enough, that it can survive what's coming, that it won't break under the weight of what she's about to do. But she's done the math on love too. She's seen how it works in poverty, how it corrodes, how it struggles, how it fights but doesn't always win. She's seen how people who love each other still fall apart when the pressure becomes too much, when survival requires sacrifice, when the cost of continuing is higher than the cost of ending.

But she nods. Accepts the promise. Chooses to believe it because what else can she do? What else is left except hope, except trying, except taking the fall and hoping you land somewhere survivable?

---

That night, Simera creates her creator account.

The process is simple. Disturbingly simple. A few forms. Some identity verification. A terms of service agreement that she doesn't read because reading it would require acknowledging what she's agreeing to, what she's becoming, what she's selling. The app congratulates her:

**WELCOME TO THE CREATOR COMMUNITY**
You're one step closer to financial freedom!
Upload your first Memento to receive your $200 sign-up bonus.

Financial freedom. The phrase is obscene. The phrase is a lie dressed in inspirational language, wrapped in the rhetoric of empowerment, sold as agency when it's actually just a different kind of cage, a prettier prison, exploitation with a motivational Instagram caption. The phrase is what you tell people when you're asking them to sell themselves, when you're convincing them that commodification is actually liberation, that turning yourself into a product is actually taking control of your life. Freedom through self-objectification. Liberation through self-commodification. Empowerment through degradation. The doublespeak makes her want to vomit.

But she accepts it. Clicks "Next." The app asks her to set up her creator profile:

**CREATOR NAME**
Choose something memorable!

She thinks. Counts: seven letters in "falling," four in "free," five in "asian," six in "flight." The words blur together, combine, recombine. Finally she types: FreeFall_Creator

**CONTENT CATEGORIES**
Select all that apply:
☐ Adventure
☐ Extreme Sports
☐ Travel
☐ Food/Dining
☐ Intimate/Relationships [18+]
☐ Thrill/Danger
☐ Other

She checks: Extreme Sports, Thrill/Danger, Intimate/Relationships. The categories that sell. The content that the market wants. The experiences that people like her pay for, that she's been consuming, that she now will produce.

The inversion is complete. Consumer to creator. Victim to victimizer. The person being exploited to the person doing the exploiting. She's crossed over. She's on the other side. She's become what she consumes.

**BIO**
Tell potential subscribers about yourself!

She writes: _I do what you're afraid to do. I go where you can't go. I experience what you need to experience. Let me fall so you don't have to._

It reads like poetry. Like advertising. Like a confession. Like a suicide note. Like a manifesto written by someone who's already dead but hasn't stopped moving yet. Like all of these at once, indistinguishable, the same words meaning everything and nothing. She saves it.

The app shows her profile: FreeFall_Creator, zero Mementos, zero subscribers, zero ratings, a blank slate waiting to be filled with experiences, with content, with pieces of herself that she'll record and sell and turn into income that will pay for survival, that will buy time, that will solve the problems that have been crushing her.

**READY TO UPLOAD YOUR FIRST MEMENTO?**
Tips for success:
- High production quality
- Clear, intense experiences
- Honest emotion (viewers can tell if you're faking)
- Push your boundaries (the market rewards bravery)

Simera looks at the button. Counts: four words, two syllables each, eight syllables total inviting her to begin, to commit, to actually do what she's been deciding to do, what she's been researching, what she's been rationalizing.

But not tonight. Tonight she's just set up the account. Tonight she's just opened the door. Tonight she's just acknowledged what she's going to do without actually doing it yet, without committing fully, without crossing that final line from decision to action.

She closes the app. Lies down next to Liz on the mattress. Liz is already asleep, or pretending to be, giving Simera space to process, to think, to count.

Simera counts: nine water stains, twenty-six cracks, seventeen bills, eight painkillers, two hundred dollars bonus waiting, one creator account created, one decision made, one fall planned, one future approaching, one person she's been and one person she's becoming, and she can't tell yet whether they're different people or the same person, whether this is transformation or just revelation, whether she's changing or just acknowledging what she's always been, what poverty has always been making her, what the system has always been training her to become.

One person. One life. One chance. One fall.

She's already falling. Has been falling since Chapter 1, since she experienced someone else's death, since she learned that dying feels more real than living, since the math stopped working and the bills turned red and survival became more important than everything else.

She's already falling. Tomorrow she'll just start recording it.

Tomorrow she'll turn her fall into income. Her fear into currency. Her body into content. Her experiences into products. Herself into a commodity.

Tomorrow she becomes a creator.

Tonight she counts ceiling cracks and tries not to think about what it will cost, what it will change, what it will make her, who she'll be when the fall ends and she lands somewhere unrecognizable, somewhere she can survive but might not recognize as survival, somewhere that solves the problems of poverty while creating new problems that she can't yet see, can't yet count, can't yet prepare for.

The numbers never lie.

But sometimes the numbers don't tell you everything.

Sometimes the numbers only reveal their full meaning after you've already committed, after you've already jumped, after you're already falling and the ground is rushing up and it's too late to change your mind, too late to choose differently, too late to do anything except experience what comes next and hope you survive it.

Simera closes her eyes. Counts her breaths: one, two, three, four. The numbers arrive like footsteps, like a heartbeat, like time itself measured in increments too small to matter but too insistent to ignore. Counts Liz's breaths beside her: slower, deeper, the breathing of someone in pain who's learned to sleep through it, who's learned to exist in a body that hurts and still find rest, still find peace, still find moments where the pain recedes enough to let sleep in. Seven breaths. Eight. Nine. The rhythm is beautiful in its steadiness, its reliability, its refusal to stop even when stopping would be easier, kinder, more logical.

Counts the seconds until tomorrow: she stops at four hundred and sixty-seven. Loses count. Starts over. Loses count again. The numbers slip away like water through fingers, like time through hands that can't hold it, like any attempt to control what can't be controlled.

Some things you can't count. Some things are too big, too uncertain, too terrifying to reduce to numbers. Some decisions can only be made, not calculated. Some falls can only be taken, not measured. Some futures can only be entered, not predicted. Some transformations happen too slowly to notice until you look back and realize the person you were doesn't exist anymore, has been replaced cell by cell, choice by choice, compromise by compromise until nothing remains of the original except the name, the body, the illusion of continuity.

Tomorrow she'll fall.

Tomorrow she'll record it.

Tomorrow she'll upload it and collect her two hundred dollars and become what she needs to become to survive what she needs to survive. Tomorrow the transformation will be complete, will be official, will be real in a way that thinking about it, planning it, rationalizing it can never be. Tomorrow she crosses over. Tomorrow she becomes a creator.

Tomorrow.

But not tonight.

Tonight she just counts cracks and breaths and the seconds passing and tries not to think about what counting has always been for her—a way to control chaos, to manage anxiety, to make sense of a world that doesn't make sense, to turn the overwhelming into the manageable, to break the unbearable into small pieces that can be endured one at a time, one number at a time. Tries not to think about how the counting has been preparing her for this, training her to see the world in numbers, in values, in commodities and costs and the mathematics of survival. How it's been teaching her that everything can be quantified, everything can be measured, everything can be assigned a number and therefore a price.

Tries not to think about how even her compulsion, her OCD, her inability to stop counting has been part of the system training her to think like a creator, to see experiences as quantifiable, to understand that everything has a value, everything has a price, everything can be sold if you're desperate enough, brave enough, broken enough. How even her illness, her disorder, her affliction has been colonized by capitalism, turned into a feature instead of a bug, a tool instead of a burden, preparation instead of pathology.

Even yourself.

Especially yourself.

Your body is a commodity. Your experiences are products. Your willingness to be hurt is a marketable skill. Your poverty is someone else's profit. Your desperation is someone else's opportunity. Your survival depends on your ability to package yourself into something consumable, to turn your life into content, to become what the market demands because the market is the only god left that answers prayers, the only force that can save you, the only thing with the power to pull you out of drowning as long as you're willing to drown in a different way, as long as you're willing to let yourself be consumed instead of just suffering, exploited instead of just poor, degraded in ways that at least pay the rent.

The numbers never lie.

They just don't tell you what it costs to believe them. They don't tell you what you lose when you reduce everything to mathematics, when you turn your life into a calculation, when you let the spreadsheet replace the story, when you sacrifice meaning on the altar of survival and call it pragmatism, call it necessity, call it the only choice when what you really mean is the only choice the system left you after it took all the others away, after it closed every door except the one that leads to this, to selling yourself, to becoming what you consume, to feeding the machine that's been feeding on you.

Tomorrow.

Tomorrow she falls and the fall is recorded and the recording is sold and the money comes in and the problems get solved and new problems appear and the cycle continues and she keeps falling, keeps recording, keeps selling, keeps becoming less human and more commodity, less person and more product, less Simera and more FreeFall_Creator until she can't tell the difference anymore, until the mask becomes the face, until the performance becomes the reality, until there's nothing left to sell except the memory of who she used to be before she learned that everything, even memory, even identity, even the self itself has a price, can be bought and sold and consumed and discarded and replaced.

But that's tomorrow.

Tonight she's still Simera. Still the person Liz loves. Still someone who counts ceiling cracks and believes the numbers will save her and doesn't know yet, can't know yet, won't know until it's too late that the numbers are the trap, not the escape, that counting was never about control but about surrender, about accepting the world's logic, about agreeing to play a game you can't win because the game is designed to extract everything from you and call it freedom, call it choice, call it your fault when you lose because you agreed to play, you signed up, you became a creator, you chose this.

Didn't you?

The question sits in the darkness with her. Unanswered. Unanswerable. The kind of question that only reveals its meaning after the fall is over, after you've landed, after you're already someone else living someone else's life in someone else's body that just happens to have your name, your face, your voice saying words you don't remember choosing, making choices you don't remember making, becoming something you don't remember deciding to become.

Simera keeps her eyes closed. Keeps counting. Keeps breathing. Keeps existing in this last moment before tomorrow arrives and changes everything, before the decision becomes action, before the plan becomes reality, before she steps off the edge and starts falling for real, starts recording it for real, starts selling it for real.

Keeps being Simera for one more night.

Just one more night.

The last night, maybe, before she becomes someone else entirely.

Before she becomes FreeFall_Creator.

Before she becomes what the market wants.

Before she becomes what poverty makes you become when you're desperate enough, when you're drowning enough, when you're out of options and out of time and out of everything except the willingness to sell what you shouldn't have to sell, to become what you shouldn't have to become, to survive in ways that feel less like surviving and more like a different kind of dying, slower but more profitable, more sustainable but more soul-destroying, keeping you alive while killing everything that makes being alive worth it.

The numbers never lie.

The numbers say: tomorrow.

The numbers say: fall.

The numbers say: this is the only way.

And she believes them.

She has to.

What else is left?
