# Chapter 4: The Creators

## Chapter Summary
Simera becomes increasingly aware of the Memento creator world. She researches them, watches interviews, sees their lavish lifestyles. The contrast between her reality and theirs is stark. She learns about the market—what sells, what pays well. The dangerous/depraved content earns the most. The parallel to social media pressure, to pornography industry pipelines. She watches created content with new eyes, seeing it as potential income rather than just experience. Maybe she encounters a creator in real life, or watches a documentary. The idea solidifies in her mind.

## Key Story Beats
- [ ] Simera researching Memento creators
- [ ] Exposure to creator culture and lifestyle
- [ ] Learning the economics: dangerous/depraved = higher pay
- [ ] The algorithm/market that pushes toward extremity
- [ ] Simera watching Mementos with analytical eyes now
- [ ] Possible encounter with an actual creator
- [ ] Discussion with Liz about the possibility (her ambivalence)
- [ ] The decision beginning to crystallize

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Her rationalization process beginning, analytical detachment, ambition stirring
- **Liz**: Her concern, but also her understanding of economic necessity, her pragmatism

## Themes to Explore
- The creator economy and exploitation
- Social media pressure parallels
- How industries lure people into increasingly extreme content
- The monetization of human experience and suffering
- The illusion of agency in economic desperation

## Atmosphere & Tone
Seductive danger. The glamour masking the darkness. A turning point where curiosity becomes intent. The sense of standing at a threshold.

## Writing Notes
- World-building: show the creator culture without info-dumping
- Make the seduction believable - it should feel like a real choice
- Liz's reaction should be nuanced, not simple opposition
- Plant details about what sells, market dynamics
- Foreshadow the darkness while showing the appeal
