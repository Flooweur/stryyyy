# Chapter 3: Scraping By

## Chapter Summary
Simera's daily life struggling to make ends meet. Show her doing small, degrading jobs. The weight of financial instability. Liz's scamming activities (show her skill at rationalization). Their attempts to survive with dignity slipping away. The temptation of Mementos as both escape and expense. Simera using Mementos she can barely afford—perhaps we see her experiencing one she purchased (hint at her preferences: Asian women, sexual encounters). The seeds are planted: Simera seeing news/ads about successful Memento creators living lavish lives.

## Key Story Beats
- [ ] Simera at a degrading job or job hunt
- [ ] Financial calculations, bills they can't pay
- [ ] Liz executing a small scam, her rationalizations
- [ ] Simera using another Memento (show her preferences subtly)
- [ ] Exposure to Memento creator lifestyle/culture
- [ ] First conscious thought: "I could do that"
- [ ] Economic pressure mounting

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Her desperation, her need for escape through Mementos, quiet humiliation
- **Liz**: Her scamming skills, how she justifies her actions, her pain (maybe she needs painkillers this chapter)

## Themes to Explore
- Economic desperation and its psychological toll
- The exploitation inherent in consumer culture
- How poverty removes choices
- Escapism as both symptom and problem
- The lure of easy money

## Atmosphere & Tone
Grinding, claustrophobic, slowly suffocating. The weight of daily survival. Brief moments of beauty or connection that make the struggle worthwhile. Growing sense that something has to give.

## Writing Notes
- Show don't tell the poverty
- Liz's scamming should be both pathetic and clever
- When Simera uses a Memento, show her preferences through the content she chooses (Asian women, sexual scenarios)
- Plant the seed organically - Simera sees creator lifestyle through ads, news, social media equivalent
- Build the economic pressure realistically
