# Chapter 3: Scraping By

The phone interview lasts nine minutes.

Simera counts them on the clock above the sink—the one with the cracked face, the second hand that stutters every fourth rotation like a heart with an arrhythmia, like something that wants to stop but hasn't figured out how yet. Nine minutes. Five hundred and forty seconds. She counts those too, watches the stuttering hand make its painful circles while a voice on the other end of the line asks questions that all mean the same thing: are you desperate enough? Are you broken enough? Will you accept what we're offering because you have no other choice?

"And you're available for overnight shifts?" The voice is female, tired, indifferent. Someone who has made this call a hundred times today, a thousand times this month. Someone who knows that desperation sounds the same in every applicant's voice, that need has a particular frequency that comes through even the shittiest phone connection.

"Yes," Simera says. Her voice is steady. Professional. The voice of someone who is fine, who is capable, who is not sitting on the edge of a mattress on the floor wearing yesterday's clothes because doing laundry costs three dollars they need for food. "I'm very flexible with scheduling."

Flexible. That's what they call it when you have no life to schedule around. When you'll take anything, anytime, because anything is better than nothing, because nothing is what's coming for you if you don't find something, anything, soon.

"Customer service experience?"

"Yes." A lie. But a small one. A kind one. The kind of lie that everyone tells because the truth—that she's never done this specific job but is absolutely capable of learning it, that capability and opportunity are not the same thing, that she's smart and desperate and those two things together make you very good at very terrible jobs—is not what they want to hear.

"The pay is minimum wage, nine-fifty an hour, overnight differential adds seventy-five cents, so ten twenty-five total. Four nights a week, ten-hour shifts. You'd be handling customer complaints, processing returns, de-escalating angry callers. It's remote but we monitor activity—camera on, active time tracking, bathroom breaks limited to ten minutes per shift. Do you have a reliable internet connection?"

Simera looks at the router on the floor, ancient and wheezing, the one they bought third-hand from a guy who swore it worked great, who failed to mention that "great" meant "functional exactly sixty-seven percent of the time." She's counted. She's tracked it. Sixty-seven percent. The other thirty-three percent they sit in darkness and silence, cut off from the world, from opportunity, from the endless digital stream of chances to make money that everyone promises is available, is democratic, is there for anyone who just tries hard enough—as long as your internet works, as long as your equipment functions, as long as you can afford the infrastructure of opportunity.

"Yes," she says. "Very reliable."

Another lie. Kinder than the truth.

"Okay." The sound of typing. Mechanical. Algorithmic. Simera wonders if there's even a person on the other end or if it's an AI, a program designed to sound tired and human and indifferent because that's what breaks people down, makes them accept less, makes them grateful for scraps. "We're interviewing through the end of the week. We'll let you know by Monday."

Monday. Four days. One hundred and sixteen hours if you're counting, which Simera is. One hundred and sixteen hours to wait while the bills sit on the table-door, while the numbers in red grow redder, while the space between now and eviction narrows like a throat closing, like a noose tightening, like the gap between a falling body and the ground.

"Thank you for your time," Simera says.

The call ends. The silence that follows is total. Simera counts the seconds: six before she hears Liz moving in the bathroom. Eleven before water runs. Eighteen before the pipes shudder and groan with the effort of pushing water upward through ancient plumbing, through infrastructure that's older than she is, that's been failing longer than she's been alive.

She sets her phone down on the mattress. Counts the cracks in the screen: three major ones, spiderwebbing out like fault lines on a map of somewhere breaking, somewhere already broken. The phone is two years old. Three years past the point where most people buy new ones, where planned obsolescence says you should upgrade, should consume, should participate in the endless cycle of buying and discarding that keeps the world grinding forward. But most people aren't calculating whether they can afford both internet and electricity in the same month. Most people aren't choosing between phone bills and food.

Most people aren't her.

The apartment is silent except for the water running, except for the building's omnipresent groan—a sound like the whole structure is in pain, like the concrete and steel are complaining about the weight they're forced to carry. Simera lies back on the mattress and stares at the ceiling. Nine water stains. She's counted them so many times they've become familiar, become companions, become the only constants in a life where everything else shifts and fails and falls apart. Twenty-six cracks in the plaster. Four places where the paint has peeled entirely away to reveal older paint beneath, and beneath that older paint still, layers of attempted renovation, of people trying to make this place livable, trying to cover the decay with fresh coats of optimism that inevitably failed, inevitably surrendered to entropy.

The building is ninety-seven years old. She looked it up once. Ninety-seven years of people living in these rooms, sleeping on these floors, staring at these ceilings, counting their own cracks and stains and failures. Ninety-seven years of poverty grinding through these walls, of desperation soaking into the floorboards, of people trying and failing and trying again and failing again because the system is designed for failure, is built on it, requires it, needs people at the bottom so people at the top have somewhere to stand.

Her phone vibrates. She counts: three short bursts. A message. She picks it up.

Liz: found a thing. come look.

Simera pulls herself up—the mattress is sunken in the middle, makes it hard to get leverage, makes it a struggle just to stand. Three steps to the bathroom. She counts them. Always counts them. Can't not count them. The numbers are involuntary, automatic, the one thing her brain insists on doing without her permission, the one compulsion she can't rationalize away, can't ignore, can't escape.

Liz is sitting on the closed toilet lid, laptop balanced on her knees. The bathroom is the only place to sit that isn't the bed or the mismatched chairs at the table-door. Four locations in the entire apartment. Four places to exist. Four positions from which to live a life.

"Look at this," Liz says. Her screen shows a website—corporate, clean, the kind of sterile design that suggests legitimacy while hiding exploitation. "Extended warranty scam. They robocall people, convince them their car warranty is expiring, charge them three hundred up front for coverage that doesn't exist. Very illegal. Very effective. Very vulnerable to counter-scamming."

"Counter-scamming," Simera repeats.

"I prefer 'ethical redistribution of stolen wealth.'" Liz's fingers fly across the keyboard. She's good at this—has a talent for finding the angles, for seeing where the seams are in the great machine that processes people into poverty. "They're scamming people out of three hundred dollars. I'm going to scam them out of... let's say, two thousand. Which is actually justice, mathematically speaking. I'm taking back what they stole, plus interest, plus a small fee for my time and expertise. I'm Robin Hood. I'm a folk hero. I'm doing the Lord's work."

"You're an atheist."

"I'm doing the Universe's work. Better?"

"The Universe is indifferent to human suffering."

"Exactly. Which is why humans have to do the work themselves. Which is what I'm doing. See? Absurdism in action. The Universe doesn't care, so we create our own meaning through small acts of larceny against people who deserve it." Liz looks up, grins—that crooked smile that still makes Simera's chest ache, still reminds her of when they met, when poverty was still theoretical, when they still believed that trying hard was enough, that systems rewarded effort, that the world was basically fair if you just worked hard enough. "How'd the interview go?"

"Nine minutes."

"That's not long."

"No."

"But you got through the whole thing?"

"Yes."

"So there's a chance."

"A small one."

"Small is better than none." Liz returns to her screen. "Small is what we're working with. Small chances. Small scams. Small amounts of money that almost add up to enough but never quite do. It's very Sisyphean. Very meaningless. Very absurd. I'm the poster child for post-industrial existential despair."

Her fingers keep moving. Simera watches her girlfriend's face—concentration, determination, that particular expression she gets when she's working an angle, when she's found a crack in the system and is figuring out how to wedge it open. Liz is thin. Getting thinner. Her cheekbones are too sharp, cut angles that catch the bathroom's fluorescent light in ways that look almost beautiful but are actually just signs of malnutrition, of poverty manifesting in bone structure, in the slow dissolution of flesh that happens when you eat enough to not starve but not enough to thrive.

"When's the last time your stomach hurt?" Simera asks.

"It's always hurting. The question is how much."

"How much right now?"

"Right now?" Liz pauses her typing. Thinks. Her hand moves to her abdomen, presses gently, testing. "A five. Maybe five point five. Manageable. I took a painkiller this morning—one of the weak ones, the ones that barely work but cost less. We have eight left. I'm rationing."

Eight pills. Simera counts them in her head, calculates: if Liz takes one every three days, that's twenty-four days of coverage. Three weeks. Not enough. Not nearly enough. The prescription costs sixty-seven dollars to refill. They don't have sixty-seven dollars. Won't have it by the time the pills run out. Which means Liz will be in pain—real pain, the kind that bends you double, that makes it impossible to think or work or do anything except endure—and there will be nothing Simera can do about it. Nothing except watch her girlfriend hurt and count the ways they're failing, count the impossibilities, count the days until something breaks that can't be fixed.

"I can pick up extra shifts," Simera says. "If I get the job. If they call back."

"If if if." Liz smiles but it doesn't reach her eyes. "The whole language of poverty. Everything is conditional. Everything is maybe. Everything is 'if this works then that might happen but probably it won't but we have to hope anyway because what else is there?'" She closes the laptop. "You know what the opposite of poverty is?"

"Money?"

"Certainty. Rich people don't say if. They say when. They say will. They live in declarative sentences. We live in conditionals. We live in a permanent state of maybe, of perhaps, of hopefully, of with luck, of if everything works out. Which it never does. But we keep saying it anyway because that's what poverty does—it makes you into an optimist against all evidence, against all reason, because pessimism is too expensive, too heavy, too true."

Simera sits on the edge of the bathtub. The tub is old, cast iron, stained brown where water has dripped from the faucet for decades. Ninety-seven years of dripping. Ninety-seven years of stains. She counts the rings: eleven distinct layers, like tree rings, like a chronicle of time measured in water damage and oxidation.

"How much do you think you'll get?" she asks. "From the scam."

"Two grand if it works. Maybe less. These things are unpredictable—you're exploiting people who are exploiting people, so there are layers of deception, everyone lying to everyone else. It's grifters all the way down. Very Hobbesian. Very 'life is nasty, brutish, and short.' Very—" She stops. Looks at Simera. "You're counting again."

"Sorry."

"Don't apologize. It's just interesting how much you count when you're stressed."

"I'm not stressed."

"You're sitting on a bathtub counting the rust rings while I plan a counter-scam against warranty scammers because we need money to buy painkillers for my failing digestive system. We're a little stressed, Sim. It's okay to admit it."

The fluorescent light above them hums—sixty cycles per second, though Simera can't count that fast, can only hear it as a continuous tone, a note of institutional misery that fluorescent lights make everywhere, in every poor person's bathroom, in every space where cost matters more than comfort. The light is unflattering, turns skin sallow, makes everyone look sick or dying or already dead. Under this light, Liz looks like a ghost. Looks like she's fading. Looks like she's becoming translucent, like Simera could put her hand through her if she tried, like her girlfriend is slowly disappearing and there's nothing either of them can do to stop it.

"I need to go out," Simera says. "Do the errands."

The errands. That's what they call it. The daily humiliation of trying to survive on nothing. Three stops today: the discount grocery store where everything is slightly expired or damaged; the check-cashing place where she'll try to negotiate another extension on the payday loan they took out six weeks ago; the community center to ask about emergency assistance programs they've already been rejected from twice but might, if they're lucky, if the right person is working, if the system is feeling generous today, might qualify for again.

"You need company?" Liz asks.

"No. Stay. Work on your scam."

"Ethical redistribution."

"Right. Your ethical redistribution."

Simera stands. Three steps to the door. She counts them. Liz calls after her: "Be careful. And Sim?"

Simera turns.

"We're going to be okay," Liz says. The lie is gentle. The lie is necessary. The lie is what keeps them both getting up in the morning, keeps them both trying, keeps them both pretending that okay is something they might eventually achieve if they just hold on long enough, just try hard enough, just survive long enough. "We are. I know it doesn't feel like it. But we will be."

Simera nods. Doesn't say anything. Leaves before the lie can be examined too closely, before the truth can intrude.

---

The discount grocery store is three blocks away. Forty-seven cracks in the sidewalk between their building and the entrance. Simera counts them. Can't help it. Her feet find them automatically, like her brain is mapping the path in fractures, in places where the concrete has given up.

The store is called SaveMart but everyone calls it the Expired Store because that's what it is—a place where grocery stores send their damaged goods, their almost-expired products, their packaging mistakes and dented cans and bruised fruit. Everything is thirty to fifty percent off. Everything is slightly wrong. Everything is what people buy when they can't afford right.

The fluorescent lights inside are the same as the bathroom's—institutional, miserable, unflattering. The aisles are narrow. The shelves are metal, rusting at the joints. Seventeen shoppers visible from the entrance. Simera counts them: twelve women, five men, all with the same expression of tired calculation, the same mathematics of poverty happening behind their eyes. How much can I get for what I have? What can I do without? Which necessities can be downgraded to luxuries I can't afford?

She grabs a basket. The handle is sticky. Proceeds to the produce section.

The vegetables are sad. Wilted. Bruised. Two dollars for a bag of carrots that look like they've given up, that have surrendered to decay and are just waiting for someone desperate enough to take them anyway. Three dollars for lettuce so brown it's more memory of lettuce than actual lettuce. The bananas are all black-spotted, overripe, the kind that you have to use immediately or throw away. Simera takes two bunches. Forty-seven cents per pound. She counts: fourteen bananas total. Seven days. Two bananas per day. The math doesn't quite work—they need more calories than that—but it's what she can afford.

Rice. Beans. The staples of poverty cuisine. Three dollars for a five-pound bag of rice. Two dollars for dried beans. She takes one of each. Adds them to the basket. The weight grows. So does the calculation in her head: so far twelve dollars. She has seventeen dollars. Five left. What else? What other necessities can she afford? What luxuries can she pretend are necessities?

Bread. One dollar for a loaf that expires tomorrow. She takes two loaves. Can freeze one. No, they can't—they sold the freezer compartment of their mini-fridge three months ago to a guy on Craigslist who paid thirty dollars cash and took it away in a van that smelled like cigarettes and failure. So two loaves, both of which will go stale in three days. They'll eat stale bread. They've eaten worse.

Fourteen dollars spent. Three dollars left. She looks at the meat section. Everything is pre-frozen, industrial, the kind of chicken that comes in plastic-wrapped trays, that has been injected with saline solution to increase the weight, to make you pay for water disguised as protein. Four dollars for a pound. She can't afford it. Moves on.

Eggs. Two dollars for a dozen. The carton is dented. She opens it: three are cracked. Nine intact. She takes it. Sixteen dollars. One dollar left.

At the register, there's a display of candy bars marked down to seventy-five cents. Chocolate. Sugar. A tiny pleasure, a small kindness in a life that contains very few of either. She looks at them for a long time. Five different kinds. She counts them: twelve total bars. Twelve small moments of sweetness available for purchase.

She doesn't buy one.

The cashier is bored, mechanical. Doesn't make eye contact. Scans the items without looking at them. The total comes to sixteen dollars and forty-seven cents. Simera counts out seventeen singles—wrinkled, soft, the kind of money that's been handled so many times it's almost falling apart—and receives fifty-three cents in change. Two quarters. Three pennies. She puts them in her pocket where they join the other change, the slow accumulation of coins that will eventually add up to another dollar, another purchase, another few hundred calories to keep them alive one more day.

"Bag is ten cents," the cashier says, already reaching for the plastic bags.

"I brought my own." Simera pulls out the reusable bag from her pocket—cloth, stained, the seams starting to split. Free from some promotion years ago. She's carried it ever since.

The groceries fit barely. The bag's handle is worn thin, close to breaking. She carries it carefully, aware that if the handle snaps she'll be carrying everything in her arms, performing poverty for everyone to see, another humiliation to add to the day's collection.

Outside, the city is gray. The sky is gray. Everything is the same exhausted color, like the whole world is tired, like existence itself is giving up, surrendering to entropy and malaise. Simera counts her steps back to the apartment: two hundred and twelve. Forty-seven cracks again. The same path in reverse. The same broken sidewalk. The same world.

---

The check-cashing place is called QuickCash and occupies a storefront between a nail salon and a place that sells phone accessories. The windows are covered with hand-painted signs advertising services: CHECK CASHING. PAYDAY LOANS. TITLE LOANS. MONEY ORDERS. Each one a way to extract wealth from people who don't have wealth, who need money so desperately they'll pay outrageous fees and interest rates for access to their own future earnings, for the privilege of borrowing from themselves.

The security guard at the door nods at her. She's been here often enough to be recognized. Often enough to be familiar. Often enough to be part of the regular circulation of desperate people who come here because banks won't serve them, because banks require minimum balances and credit scores and the infrastructure of financial stability that people like her don't have, can't have, will never have.

Inside, the space is small. Bulletproof glass separates the customers from the employees. Three stations. Eight people waiting. She takes a number from the dispenser: forty-seven. The last person served was forty-two. Five people ahead of her. She sits in one of the plastic chairs bolted to the floor and waits. Counts: eleven chairs total. Six occupied including hers. Five empty. Seventeen tiles on the floor, each one yellowed and cracked. Four cameras in the corners of the room, recording everything, watching everything, making sure nobody tries anything stupid, nobody tries to take back what's being taken from them legally, systematically, with contracts and terms and conditions that are all designed to keep you paying, keep you desperate, keep you coming back.

The woman ahead of her is arguing with the teller. "I said I'd pay next week. I just need a few more days."

The teller's voice is professional, mechanical. "The terms of your loan specified payment today. There's a late fee if you don't pay today."

"How much?"

"Seventy-five dollars."

"That's insane."

"That's the terms of your contract."

The woman's shoulders slump. Defeated. She pays. The transaction completes. She walks past Simera on her way out, eyes down, carrying the weight of it—not just the money but the indignity, the humiliation, the knowledge that she's being exploited and there's nothing she can do about it because the alternative is worse, because not having money at all is worse than having money that costs too much.

Number forty-three is called. Forty-four. Forty-five. Simera watches the transactions through the bulletproof glass. Watches money change hands. Watches desperation being processed, systematized, monetized. This is what poverty looks like in practice: people in plastic chairs, numbers on a screen, fees that compound, interest that crushes, a machine that grinds people down and extracts value from their suffering.

"Forty-seven."

Simera stands. Approaches the window. The teller is young, can't be more than twenty-two, twenty-three. Younger than Simera. Probably makes minimum wage. Probably lives in an apartment like hers, probably has her own debts, her own desperation. They're both trapped in the same machine, just at different gears, both being ground down, both necessary for the system to function.

"I need an extension on my loan," Simera says.

The teller types. Looks at the screen. "You took out five hundred dollars six weeks ago. Current balance with interest is six hundred and forty-three dollars. You've paid back two hundred. You owe four hundred and forty-three. The loan was due last week."

"I know. I just need another two weeks. I'm interviewing for a job—"

"I can't give extensions without a fee."

"How much?"

"Eighty dollars."

Simera counts in her head: eighty dollars for two weeks. That's forty dollars per week. One hundred and sixty dollars per month. For the privilege of not paying what she owes yet. For the privilege of delaying the inevitable. It's more than the minimum wage job will pay after taxes, after deductions, after the grinding mathematics of poverty take their cut. It's impossible. It's usury. It's legal.

"What if I can't pay that?"

"Then the loan goes into default. We sell the debt to a collection agency. Your credit score drops. You'll have trouble borrowing in the future."

Trouble borrowing in the future. As if borrowing is the goal. As if the point is to keep borrowing, keep paying, keep feeding the machine that feeds on desperation. As if there's a future where she won't need to borrow, where she'll have enough, where the math will finally work in her favor instead of against her.

"I'll pay it," Simera says.

She doesn't have eighty dollars. But she'll find it. Somehow. Liz's scam. Another job. Something. The alternative is default, collections, the harassment, the phone calls, the letters, the slow legal grinding that ends with garnished wages and damaged credit and doors closing, opportunities disappearing, the already-narrow path to stability becoming narrower still.

The teller processes it. "You'll need to pay the eighty dollars today. For the extension."

"I don't have it today."

"Then I can't process the extension."

They look at each other through the bulletproof glass. Two people trapped in the same conversation that happens in this room a hundred times a day, a thousand times a week, an endless loop of desperation meeting inflexibility, of need meeting policy, of human suffering meeting bureaucratic indifference.

"End of the week," Simera says. "I'll have it end of the week."

"I'll make a note in your file. But if you don't pay by Friday, it goes to collections Monday."

"I understand."

She doesn't understand. She understands too well. She understands that this is how it works—every day you survive is another day you pay for, every breath costs, every extension has a fee, every tomorrow is more expensive than today. She understands that the system is designed this way, that it's working exactly as intended, that her suffering is not a bug but a feature, not a failure but a profit center, not an accident but the whole fucking point.

She leaves. The security guard doesn't nod this time. He's seen too many people come and go, too much desperation processed, too much humanity degraded. He's numb to it. They all are. You have to be, to work in a place like this, to facilitate this kind of extraction, to be the human face of a machine that exists only to crush people who are already broken.

Outside, Simera counts: eight steps to the sidewalk. Forty-seven cracks back to the apartment. She counts them all. The numbers are the only thing that makes sense. The numbers are the only truth. The numbers say: you owe more than you have. You will always owe more than you have. This is what it means to be poor. This is what it costs to survive. This is the arithmetic of poverty, and it never balances, never resolves, never ends.

---

By the time she gets home, it's afternoon. The forty-seven minutes of sunlight that reaches their window has come and gone. The apartment is dim, gray, the color of giving up. Liz is at the table-door, laptop open, phone to her ear, voice smooth and confident in a way that means she's mid-scam, mid-performance, being someone else, someone who has power and authority and the ability to make other people do what she wants.

"—understand your concern, but the refund processing timeline is thirty to forty-five days. That's standard for transactions over five hundred dollars. Yes. Yes, I understand that's frustrating, but our hands are tied by federal banking regulations. The best I can do is expedite it to thirty days. Would that be acceptable?"

She's good. Very good. Her voice has none of the desperation that usually lives there, none of the edge of pain, none of the exhaustion. She's playing a character—someone professional, someone who works in an office with fluorescent lights and ergonomic chairs, someone who has health insurance and paid vacation, someone whose biggest concern is following proper procedure rather than where their next meal is coming from.

She notices Simera, waves, keeps talking.

"Excellent. I'll process that now. You should see the refund in your account within thirty days. Is there anything else I can help you with today? No? Then thank you for your patience, and have a great afternoon."

She hangs up. Her whole body relaxes, slumps, the performance ending, the real Liz returning—tired, thin, hurting.

"How much?" Simera asks.

"Potentially two grand. Won't know for sure until the transfer clears. If it clears. There's maybe a forty percent chance they figure it out before then, freeze the account, report it. But forty percent success rate on two thousand dollars is better than a hundred percent success rate on nothing, which is what we currently have." She closes the laptop. "How were the errands?"

"Fine."

"That's a lie."

"Yes."

"That bad?"

Simera sits down. Puts her head in her hands. Counts: ten fingers. Two hands. One head that feels too heavy, that she can barely hold up, that feels like it's full of stones, of numbers, of calculations that never resolve, that never end, that just accumulate like debt, like interest, like the weight of trying to survive in a world that charges you for the privilege of not dying.

"They want eighty dollars by Friday," she says. "For the extension. If I don't pay, it goes to collections."

Liz is quiet. Then: "Okay. We'll figure it out. We always do."

"No, we don't. We're drowning. We've been drowning. We just keep telling ourselves we're swimming because the alternative is admitting we're going to drown, and admitting that is too hard, too true, too final."

"Very poetic. Very bleak. Very you when you've had a bad day." Liz reaches across the table-door, takes Simera's hand. Her palm is warm, dry, real. "We haven't drowned yet. That counts for something."

"Does it?"

"Has to. Otherwise what's the point of any of this?"

Simera looks at their hands—her girlfriend's fingers thin, too thin, the bones too prominent, the skin almost translucent in the gray light. She counts the visible veins: seven on the back of Liz's hand, branching like rivers on a map of somewhere beautiful that they'll never visit, somewhere alive that they'll never afford to see.

"The interview was nine minutes," Simera says. "They're deciding by Monday. The job pays minimum wage. Ten twenty-five an hour with overnight differential. Forty hours a week if I get it. That's four hundred and ten dollars weekly, sixteen hundred and forty monthly before taxes. After taxes maybe thirteen hundred. Our rent is nine hundred. Bills are another four hundred. That leaves us negative three hundred for food, medicine, your painkillers, everything else. The math doesn't work. Even if I get it, even if your scam pays out, even if everything goes right, the math still doesn't work. We're spending more than we have. Every month we fall further behind. Every month we owe more. Every month—"

"Stop." Liz's voice is gentle but firm. "Stop counting. Just for a minute. Just stop."

"I can't."

"Try."

Simera tries. Closes her eyes. Tries to not count her breaths, her heartbeats, the seconds passing, the cracks in the ceiling above her, the ways they're failing, the days until eviction, the dollars they don't have, the impossibilities that keep accumulating like interest, like debt, like the weight of existence in a world that makes you pay for everything including the privilege of continuing to exist in it.

She can't. The numbers keep coming. They always do. They're involuntary, relentless, the one thing her brain won't let her escape. Seven breaths. Nineteen heartbeats. Forty-three seconds of trying and failing to not count.

"I can't," she says again.

Liz squeezes her hand. "Okay. Then count this: one girlfriend who loves you. One apartment that's shitty but ours. One chance at a job. One scam that might work. One more day alive. One more day trying. That counts for something, Sim. It has to."

One. Singular. The loneliest number. The most desperate number. The number you use when you're down to your last anything—last dollar, last chance, last hope, last reason to keep going.

"I need to use a Memento," Simera says quietly.

Liz's face doesn't change but something shifts behind her eyes. Disappointment, maybe. Or resignation. Or just tired acceptance that this is how Simera copes, how she survives, how she escapes when the grinding reality becomes too much, when the math doesn't work and the future looks like drowning and the present is just enduring until the future arrives and drowns you.

"Okay," Liz says.

"We can't afford it."

"We can't afford a lot of things. We do them anyway. That's called being alive."

"The cheapest ones are eight dollars."

"We have eight dollars."

"Barely."

"Barely is enough. Go ahead. I'll be here." Liz stands, winces slightly—the pain, always the pain, always lurking beneath everything she does, every movement a negotiation with her own body, every day a struggle against flesh that's failing from the inside out. "I need to lie down anyway. My stomach is getting worse. Maybe I'll take another pill. We have eight left. Sorry, seven. Seven is still something. Seven is almost a week if I'm careful."

She doesn't wait for a response. Goes to the bed. Lies down. Curls on her side, knees pulled up, the fetal position that means her stomach is hurting worse than she's admitting, worse than a five-point-five, more like a seven or an eight, the kind of pain that makes it hard to think, hard to breathe, hard to be anything except a body that hurts.

Simera watches her for a long time. Counts Liz's breaths: twelve shallow ones, three deeper, another eight shallow. The breathing of someone in pain, someone trying not to move too much, someone trying to minimize everything—movement, breath, existence itself—because existing hurts and the less you exist the less it hurts.

She picks up her phone. Opens the Memento app. The screen glows in the dim apartment, bright and inviting and offering escape, offering sensation, offering a life that's not this one, experiences that aren't this grinding daily humiliation of trying to survive on nothing.

Knows what she wants before she wants it—falling and fucking, terror and intimacy, the two things that make her feel alive, the two experiences that cut through the numbness of poverty and make her feel something, anything, make her feel like she exists as something more than a set of calculations that don't add up, a collection of debts she can't pay, a body that's hungry in more ways than just food.

She chooses the Bangkok one. The cheapest. Eight ninety-nine. She can almost justify it. Almost. The transaction processes. Three seconds. The Memento downloads. File size: 2.1 gigabytes. Forty-seven minutes of someone else's experience, someone else's pleasure, someone else's life compressed into data that her brain will expand into sensation, into memory, into experience that feels real even though it isn't, even though it's just electrical signals overwriting her consciousness, replacing her self with someone else's self for the duration of the playback.

She plugs the wire into the jack behind her ear. The connection is immediate, comfortable, familiar. She's done this so many times it's automatic—the ritual of escape, the procedure of leaving herself behind. She counts: three deep breaths to prepare. Two taps on the screen to start. One moment of hesitation before—

The night market is sound and smell and heat.

Simera—no, not Simera, not anymore, someone else now, someone whose life she's borrowing, whose experience she's consuming—walks through narrow aisles between food stalls that overflow with color and steam and the smoke of grilling meat. Vendors call out in Thai, words she doesn't understand but recognizes as invitations, as commerce, as the universal language of buying and selling. The air is thick, humid, heavy with spices and sweat and the smell of too many bodies in too small a space. Music plays from somewhere, loud and rhythmic and foreign. Lights string overhead, red and gold and white, turning the narrow market into a tunnel of illumination, into a corridor of life lived louder and brighter and more intensely than anything she's experienced in years, decades, maybe ever in her real life.

She's wearing a dress. Short. Black. She can feel the fabric against her thighs, feel the way it moves when she walks. Heels—not high, just enough to change her posture, to make her stand differently, move differently. She feels beautiful. That's the first thing she notices: she feels beautiful in a way she doesn't feel in her own body, in her own clothes, in her own life. This body is confident. This body knows it's attractive. This body moves through the world expecting to be looked at, expecting to be desired.

She passes a stall selling pad thai, another selling mango sticky rice, another selling something fried on a stick. Her stomach isn't hungry. That's the second thing: no hunger. This body has eaten recently. This body has enough. This body doesn't calculate the cost of every calorie, doesn't ration, doesn't choose between food and other necessities. This body just exists without that constant gnawing awareness of scarcity, without that grinding background calculation of can I afford this, can I afford to exist, can I afford to keep being alive.

Someone calls out—a woman's voice, accented, amused. "You look lost."

She turns. The woman is standing in front of a stall selling silk scarves, but she's not selling, just standing, just watching, just smiling in a way that means something, means invitation, means recognition. She's maybe thirty, maybe younger. Asian—Thai, probably. Dark hair pulled back. Eyes that catch the light. She's wearing jeans and a white tank top and she makes both look like deliberate choices, like fashion instead of just clothing. She's beautiful. Not magazine beautiful. Real beautiful. The kind of beautiful that lives in actual bodies, in specific faces, in the way someone stands and smiles and looks at you like you're the only person in the crowd, like you're what she's been waiting for.

"I'm not lost," she says. Her voice—not her voice, the creator's voice—is confident, amused, playing the game. "I'm exploring."

"Exploring." The woman steps closer. "What are you hoping to find?"

"I'll know when I find it."

The woman laughs. "Americans. So direct. But also not direct enough. You want to walk with me? I know places that tourists don't find. Better places. Quieter. More interesting."

This is the moment. The decision point in the recording. The moment when the creator chose to follow, to trust, to say yes to a stranger in a foreign city, to let themselves be led into an unknown experience that might be dangerous or might be beautiful or might be both. The moment when risk becomes opportunity, when fear becomes excitement, when the grinding safety of saying no gives way to the possibility of saying yes.

"Yes," she says. "Show me."

They walk. The woman leads her through the market, around corners, down alleyways that get narrower and darker, away from the lights and the crowd, away from safety and into something else. Simera feels it—the thrill of it, the fear of it, the electric awareness that anything could happen, that she's stepping outside the boundaries of safety, that she's trusting a stranger in a way that's either incredibly stupid or incredibly brave. Her heart is beating fast. Not from fear. From anticipation. From desire. From the knowledge that something is about to happen, something good, something that her body wants even though her mind is still calculating risks, still counting dangers, still trying to maintain control.

But control is already gone. That's what makes this so intense. She's given up control. She's following. She's trusting. She's surrendering to whatever happens next.

The alley opens into a small courtyard. Quiet. Dark. No tourists. No crowds. Just space and shadows and the distant sound of the market behind them, muted, far away. There's a door, a building, something residential or commercial, she can't tell. The woman opens it. Inside: stairs, narrow and steep, leading up. They climb. Two flights. Three. The woman unlocks another door at the top. They enter.

It's a small apartment. One room. Simera recognizes it immediately—the layout, the size, the efficiency of poverty. But this one is different. Clean. Organized. Personal. There are plants in the window, art on the walls, small touches that make it a home instead of just a place to survive. This is someone's actual space, their real life, and they've invited her into it, which means something, which means trust, which means this isn't transactional, isn't business, is something else, something more intimate, something that makes her breath catch because genuine connection is so rare, so precious, so unexpected that when it arrives it feels like grace.

"You want a drink?" the woman asks.

"Yes."

She pours something clear from a bottle without labels. Homemade, probably. Local. They sit on a low couch that doubles as a bed. Their thighs touch. The touch is electric, deliberate, acknowledged. The woman looks at her—really looks, the kind of looking that sees, that recognizes, that names the desire that's been building since the market, since the alley, since the moment their eyes met.

"You've done this before," the woman says. Not a question.

"Done what?"

"Followed a stranger home. Let someone you don't know bring you to a place you've never been. Trusted a woman you just met."

"Not often."

"But sometimes."

"Sometimes."

"Why?"

The question hangs between them. Why do you do this? Why do you take risks? Why do you say yes when saying no is safer, easier, more rational? Why do you choose experience over security, sensation over safety, the possibility of connection over the certainty of loneliness?

"Because saying no gets boring," she says. "Because safe is just another word for nothing happens. Because I'd rather have stories than safety."

The woman smiles. Sets down her drink. "I like that answer."

Then she kisses her.

The kiss is soft at first, questioning, making sure. Then deeper. Hands moving—in her hair, on her back, pulling her closer. The dress is thin, provides no barrier. She can feel everything—the heat of the other woman's body, the softness of her skin, the strength in her hands. They're lying down now, somehow, the transition happened without her noticing. The couch is narrow. They're pressed together. She can feel the other woman's heartbeat, can taste her—something sweet, the drink maybe, or just the taste of her mouth, of this person, of this moment. Her hands are moving on their own, exploring, learning this body, this person, this experience that's happening to her, that she's choosing, that she's surrendering to.

The woman pulls back slightly. Looks at her. "You're beautiful," she says. "I saw you in the market and I thought, that one. That one is worth talking to. That one looks like she says yes to things. Like she's brave enough to follow strangers. Brave enough to see where things go."

"I'm not brave," she says. "I'm just tired of being safe."

"Same thing, maybe."

Then they're kissing again. Clothes are coming off—the dress over her head, the woman's tank top, jeans, underwear, all of it shed like they're shedding their selves, their histories, everything except this moment, this contact, this connection. The woman's body is warm, soft, strong. Her hands know what they're doing—confident, skilled, paying attention to responses, to what makes her gasp, to what makes her arch into the touch. This is someone who has done this before, who knows how to touch another woman, who takes pleasure in giving pleasure.

They move together. Slowly at first, then faster, more urgent. Hands and mouths and the slide of skin on skin. She makes sounds she didn't know she was capable of. The woman does too. They're talking without words, communicating through touch, through rhythm, through the language of bodies that recognize each other, that fit together in a way that feels both surprising and inevitable, both new and familiar.

She comes first—unexpected, sudden, overwhelming. The woman holds her through it, kisses her neck, whispers something in Thai that she doesn't understand but recognizes as affection, as care, as the kind of tenderness that makes her chest ache because it's so rare, so precious, so exactly what she needs. Then she returns the favor, paying attention, learning, figuring out what the woman likes, what makes her breath catch, what makes her grip the sheets, what makes her finally shudder and gasp and hold on like she's falling.

Afterwards they lie tangled together, sweating, breathing hard. The woman strokes her hair. She counts the touches: seven, eight, nine. Can't help it. Even here, even in this moment of satisfaction and connection, her brain still counts. But the counting is gentler now, less frantic. The numbers are just information, not anxiety. Just a way of measuring the world, of making sense of it, of holding onto something concrete when everything else is sensation and emotion and the pleasant exhaustion of having been fully, completely present in her body, in this experience, in this moment of escape from herself.

"You want to stay?" the woman asks. "Tonight. You can stay if you want."

She wants to say yes. Wants to stay in this body, this experience, this life where she's brave and beautiful and says yes to strangers, where connection is possible, where satisfaction is available, where she exists as something more than a set of calculations that don't work, a collection of needs that can't be met, a person whose life is just grinding daily survival punctuated by moments of escape that cost money she doesn't have.

But the Memento is ending. She can feel it—the edges of the experience getting fuzzy, the sensations fading, her real body asserting itself, reminding her that she's not in Bangkok, not in a stranger's apartment, not in a body that feels beautiful and confident and satisfied. She's in a one-room apartment in a city that's gray and dying, lying on a mattress on the floor, wearing yesterday's clothes, existing in a poverty so complete that she has to pay to feel human, has to borrow someone else's experiences to remember what it's like to want something other than money, to desire something other than survival, to be something other than desperate.

The woman's face starts to dissolve. The apartment fades. The warmth of the other body becomes phantom sensation, memory, data being cleared from her brain as the device powers down, as the experience ends, as—

---

Simera opens her eyes.

The ceiling. Nine water stains. Twenty-six cracks. The familiar geography of her poverty, her prison, her life. She's sweating. The mattress is soaked beneath her. Her heart is racing. Between her legs, the ache of arousal that wasn't satisfied in her real body, that exists only in the neural pathways that the Memento stimulated, that remember sensation without having actually experienced it.

She's been crying. Her face is wet. She doesn't remember starting to cry. Doesn't remember the transition from pleasure to grief, from satisfaction to loss. But they're connected, those feelings. They're the same feeling, really. The same awareness: that experience was beautiful, was real in its way, was everything she wanted. And it wasn't hers. None of it was hers. She borrowed it. Bought it. Consumed it like a product, like a commodity, like a drug that makes you feel alive while you're using it and makes you feel more dead when it wears off.

"Hey." Liz's voice, quiet, careful. "You're back."

Simera turns her head. Liz is lying beside her, propped on one elbow, watching. Her face is concerned, sad, the expression of someone who has watched this happen too many times, who knows what Simera looks like when she comes back from a Memento, who sees the aftermath, the crash, the re-entry into a reality that's so much worse than the borrowed experience that the contrast itself is painful.

"I'm back," Simera says. Her voice is rough. Thick with tears she's still crying, can't stop crying, doesn't know why she's crying except that the beauty of what she just experienced makes the ugliness of her real life unbearable in comparison, makes existence itself feel like punishment, like penance for some crime she doesn't remember committing.

"Good one?"

"Yeah."

"Want to talk about it?"

"No."

Liz nods. Doesn't push. Just lies back down beside her. Their bodies aren't touching. There's space between them—six inches, maybe seven. Simera counts the distance. Counts the gap. Counts the ways they're separate even when they're together, the ways that Simera is always a little bit absent, always a little bit somewhere else, always thinking about the next Memento, the next escape, the next borrowed experience that will make her feel alive in ways that her actual life, her actual girlfriend, her actual existence never quite manages.

"I spent nine dollars," Simera says.

"I know."

"We need that money."

"I know."

"I'm sorry."

"Stop apologizing." Liz's hand finds hers. Squeezes. "You needed it. I get it. We'll figure out the money."

But the money is the least of it. The real cost isn't the nine dollars. The real cost is lying here in the aftermath, counting the distance between their bodies, feeling the absence where connection should be, knowing that she just spent forty-seven minutes experiencing intimacy with a stranger in a Memento while her girlfriend lies next to her in pain, in poverty, in the real world that Simera keeps trying to escape because being present in it, being here, being real is too hard, too painful, too grinding to endure without regular infusions of borrowed experiences, borrowed pleasures, borrowed lives.

Her phone is still in her hand. She looks at it. The Memento app is still open. The screen shows:

Simera stares at it. The banner has been there before. She's scrolled past it a hundred times, a thousand times. Ignored it. Refused to acknowledge what it offered, what it meant, what it would cost. But now, lying in the aftermath of a Memento she couldn't afford, in an apartment they're about to be evicted from, next to a girlfriend who's getting thinner and sicker because they can't afford the medication that would help, staring at a future that looks like drowning, the banner looks different. Looks possible. Looks like the only option left.

The math is simple: she just spent nine dollars to consume someone else's experience for forty-seven minutes. Someone got paid for creating that. Someone recorded themselves following a stranger home, fucking a woman they just met, turning intimacy into data, into content, into a product that people like Simera would buy because people like Simera are so desperate for sensation, for experience, for feeling alive that they'll pay for it, that they'll borrow other people's lives because their own lives are unlivable, unbearable, insufficient.

Someone is making money from this. Someone created what she just consumed. Someone turned their body, their willingness to take risks, their sexuality, their life into income. Into enough income that they can afford more than a one-room apartment and a door for a table and counting cracks and calculating whether they can afford both internet and electricity in the same month.

Someone is surviving by being what she consumes. By creating what she needs. By doing what she just experienced except for real, in their real life, and recording it, and selling it, and making enough money that they don't have to spend their days in check-cashing places and discount grocery stores and jobs that pay minimum wage and barely cover rent let alone food let alone medicine let alone the cost of being alive, of continuing to exist, of not drowning.

The math is simple. The math has always been simple. She's just been refusing to do it, refusing to see it, refusing to acknowledge the obvious solution to an impossible problem.

She could do what they do. She could create instead of just consume. She could turn her body, her experiences, her willingness to do things that other people won't do into income. Into enough income that Liz could buy painkillers that actually work. That they could pay rent on time. That they could eat food that isn't expired or damaged or bruised. That they could stop drowning and start surviving and maybe, possibly, eventually start living.

The math is simple. The choice is simple. The solution has been there all along, has been advertised to her, has been offered to her every time she opened the app, every time she bought a Memento, every time she participated in the system as a consumer instead of a creator, as someone being exploited instead of someone doing the exploiting, as someone at the bottom instead of someone who has figured out how to climb up by turning themselves into a commodity, into content, into a product that other desperate people will buy because desperation is infinite, because the market for escape is unlimited, because there will always be more people like her who need to feel something other than the grinding misery of poverty, who need to experience something other than their own failing lives.

The math is simple. She's a consumer. She could be a creator. Consumers pay. Creators get paid. She needs to get paid. Therefore: she should become a creator.

The logic is airtight. The logic has always been airtight. She's just been too scared, too proud, too something to acknowledge it, to see it, to do it. But fear and pride are luxuries. They're things you can afford when you have enough money, enough security, enough of a buffer between you and drowning. When you don't have those things, when you're already underwater, when you're already suffocating, fear and pride become irrelevant, become obstacles, become the very things that keep you trapped in poverty while other people—smarter people, braver people, more desperate people—figure out how to escape by turning themselves into products, into content, into the thing that desperate people consume.

"Sim?" Liz's voice pulls her back. "What are you thinking about?"

Simera looks at her girlfriend. Really looks at her. At the sharp cheekbones that are beautiful in pictures but in real life just mean malnutrition, mean poverty, mean a body that's slowly eating itself because there's not enough food, not enough calories, not enough of anything. At the hand on her stomach where the pain lives, where something is wrong that they can't afford to fix, can't afford to treat, can barely afford to medicate. At the woman she loves who is suffering, who is enduring, who is trying to maintain dignity and principles and absurdist humor in a world that rewards none of those things, that punishes people for being principled, that grinds down dignity, that makes jokes into survival mechanisms instead of actual joy.

"Nothing," Simera says. "Just thinking."

"That's a lie."

"I know."

"You want to tell me the truth?"

Simera looks back at her phone. At the banner. At the promise, the lie, the truth that might be both. At the only way out of a situation that has no other exits, no other options, no other possibilities except drowning slowly or drowning fast or figuring out how to turn yourself into a product that other people will buy so you can stop drowning and start breathing.

"Not yet," she says. "Soon. But not yet."

Liz doesn't push. Never pushes. Just nods, accepts it, gives Simera space to figure things out, to come to conclusions, to make decisions that she's already made but isn't ready to acknowledge, isn't ready to say out loud because saying it out loud makes it real in a way that thinking it doesn't, makes it a choice instead of just a possibility, makes it something she's committed to instead of something she's considering.

But she's already committed. She knows it. She knew it the moment she saw the banner. Maybe before that. Maybe at the end of Chapter 2 when she first thought about it, first acknowledged the possibility, first did the math and realized that the numbers only work one way, that survival only has one path, that drowning has only one exit and it looks like becoming the thing she consumes, creating the thing she needs, turning herself into content that other desperate people will buy to escape their own drowning.

Maybe she's known since the first fall, since she experienced someone else's death and realized that dying feels more real than living, that borrowed experiences are more intense than actual experiences, that somewhere out there is a person brave enough or broken enough to record themselves jumping off a building so people like her can pay to feel it, to experience it, to consume their death and wake up still alive and grateful for the intensity of it, the sensation of it, the reality of it in a world where reality has become optional, has become consumable, has become something you can buy if you have money and something you can sell if you don't.

Maybe she's always known. Maybe poverty has always been training her for this. Teaching her that everything can be sold, that survival requires selling yourself piece by piece, that dignity and pride and principles are luxuries that poor people can't afford, that the only way to escape exploitation is to become the exploiter, to turn yourself from victim to perpetrator, from consumer to creator, from the person being used to the person doing the using.

Maybe this was always inevitable. Maybe this is just what capitalism does: takes people who are desperate and offers them one way out, one path to survival, one choice that isn't really a choice because the alternative is drowning, is suffering, is watching the people you love get thinner and sicker and more broken while you count the ways you're failing them, count the debts you can't pay, count the days until everything collapses completely.

Maybe this is just what poverty does: makes you into someone who sells themselves because selling yourself is the only asset you have left when everything else has been taken, has been extracted, has been used up by a system designed to crush people like you and profit from your crushing.

Maybe there never was a choice.

Maybe thinking about it, analyzing it, understanding it is just another form of procrastination, another way of delaying the inevitable, another method of pretending she has a choice when the choice has already been made, the decision has already been reached, the math has already been done and the numbers only work one way.

She's going to do it. She's going to become a creator. She's going to turn herself into content, into a product, into a commodity that other people will consume. She's going to record her experiences and sell them because selling them is the only way to survive, the only way to get Liz the medication she needs, the only way to pay the bills and make rent and stop drowning and start breathing and maybe, possibly, eventually have a life that's something more than grinding daily survival punctuated by moments of escape that cost money she doesn't have.

She's going to do it. She's known since the banner appeared. Maybe longer. Maybe forever. Maybe this was always where she was heading, what she was becoming, who poverty was shaping her into.

The only question left is when. When will she admit it? When will she say it out loud? When will she stop pretending she has other options and acknowledge the only option that's left?

Not today. But soon. Very soon. The countdown has started. The decision has been made. The future is arriving like the ground after a long fall, inevitable and fast and absolutely certain.

Simera closes her eyes. Counts: nine water stains, twenty-six cracks, seventeen bills, three red, eight dollars spent, eighty dollars owed, forty-seven minutes borrowed, one girlfriend suffering, one decision made but not yet acknowledged, one future approaching, one fall waiting to be recorded, one life waiting to be sold, one choice that was never really a choice, one person becoming something else, something worse, something more profitable, something that can survive in a world designed to crush people who aren't willing to sell themselves completely.

One. Singular. The loneliest number. The number of options she has left. The number of ways out. The number of futures available to her. The number of choices that aren't really choices.

One.

Just one.

That's all poverty ever leaves you.

One way forward. One way out. One way to survive.

And she's going to take it.

Soon.

Very soon.

The numbers never lie. The numbers say: fall. The numbers say: sell. The numbers say: become what you consume. The numbers say: this is what survival costs.

And she's going to pay it.

She has no other choice.

She never did.
