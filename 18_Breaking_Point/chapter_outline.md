# Chapter 18: The Discovery

## Chapter Summary
Simera comes home. The apartment is too quiet. She calls for Liz. No answer. She finds her in the bedroom. Liz is on the bed, convulsing. Foam at her mouth. The device still plugged into the port behind her ear. The scene is terrifying, visceral—this is the nightmare, the horror, the thing they always feared but never really believed would happen. Simera screams, rushes to her, pulls the device out, tries to help. Liz's body is seizing. Her eyes are open but unseeing. This is not a Memento experience—this is overdose, poisoning, something catastrophic happening in her brain. Simera calls emergency services, her hands shaking, her mind fracturing. She tries to do what they tell her—turn Liz on her side, clear her airway, keep her breathing. But Liz is dying. Maybe she dies before the ambulance arrives, or in the ambulance, or at the hospital—but Liz dies. Through the horror, Simera sees Liz's phone. The screen shows a transaction: black market Memento purchased, modified content, warnings ignored. The file name suggests something extreme, dangerous, possibly illegal. Liz bought it, used it, and it killed her. The chapter ends with Liz dead and Simera shattered. The love of her life is gone. The person she tried to save, failed to save, enabled instead of helping. Everything is broken. This is the point where Simera's mental state begins its final descent.

## Atmosphere & Tone
Absolute horror. Visceral, immediate, devastating. The nightmare scene. Fast-paced panic, then slow-motion horror. The moment of death should devastate the reader completely. This is the emotional climax. Make them feel the full weight of loss. This should be one of the most powerful scenes in the book. Afterward: numb, shattered, the silence after catastrophe.

- This is the moment that breaks Simera irrevocably
- Everything after this leads to her death
