# Chapter 2: Awakening

## Chapter Summary
Simera fully comes back to reality, dealing with the physical and psychological aftermath of the intense Memento. This chapter grounds us in the real world for the first time—their cramped apartment, the visible signs of financial struggle. Liz's concern mixed with her sardonic humor. We see the dynamic between them: Liz's principles against Mementos, but no judgment toward Simera. Introduction to the world-building: how the device works, what Mementos are, the existence of Heri corporation. Subtle details about both characters' personalities and quirks.

## Key Story Beats
- [ ] Simera's disorientation and physical recovery
- [ ] The small, struggling apartment - show poverty
- [ ] Liz removing/discussing the device
- [ ] Natural exposition about Mementos and how they work
- [ ] Liz's wit and absurdist philosophy showing through dialogue
- [ ] First hints of Simera's OCD (counting objects in the room)
- [ ] Their relationship dynamic - intimate but strained by circumstances
- [ ] Subtle worldbuilding without info-dumping

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Post-Memento vulnerability, her need for these experiences, subtle OCD manifestations
- **Liz**: Caretaker role, wit as defense mechanism, her chronic pain mentioned, her principles

## Themes to Explore
- The contrast between simulated and real experience
- Economic desperation
- Love in the face of principle differences
- The addictive nature of escapism

## Atmosphere & Tone
Grounded, intimate, slightly melancholic. The comedown after the high. Show the gray reality that makes the Mementos so appealing. Tenderness between Simera and Liz despite hardship.

## Writing Notes
- Natural dialogue - show their relationship through conversation
- World-building through action and dialogue, not exposition
- Physical details that reveal poverty without stating it
- Simera counting things unconsciously
- Liz's pain mentioned casually, not dwelled upon
