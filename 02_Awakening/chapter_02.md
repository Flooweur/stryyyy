# Chapter 2: Awakening

The coffee tastes like rust and regret and the copper aftertaste of old pipes.

Simera wraps her hands around the mug—chipped ceramic, white once, now the color of old teeth, the color of bones left in the sun too long—and counts the cracks spiderwebbing across its surface. Seven major fractures. Nineteen smaller ones branching off like tributaries from a dying river, like veins under translucent skin. The heat seeps through, almost burning, but she holds on anyway. Pain is clarifying. Pain is honest in a way nothing else is anymore. Pain reminds you that you're still here, still alive, still tethered to a body that insists on continuing despite having no good reason to, despite the betrayal of waking up when falling promised an ending.

Liz sits across from her at what they call the table. Not a table, really—a door laid across two filing cabinets they found on the street three months ago, already rusting. The door still has its knob, brass tarnished to the color of old pennies, the color of dried blood. Simera counts the scratches around the lock mechanism: twenty-three. Someone tried to break into this door, back when it was still a door, back when it stood vertical and had purpose, back when it protected something worth stealing, something worth wanting.

Now it's just where they eat. Where they perform the ritual of normalcy. Where they sit across from each other and drink terrible coffee and try not to acknowledge the bills stacked at the far end like a cairn marking a grave they're both digging, one day at a time, one unpaid invoice at a time.

"You're counting again," Liz says. Not accusatory. Just observing. Just naming the thing they both know.

Simera's fingers stop their unconscious tracing of the mug's cracks. "Sorry."

"Don't be sorry. Just drink your coffee before it gets cold. Or colder. I don't think this shit was ever actually hot." A beat. A small smile. "I think it was born lukewarm. I think it came into existence disappointed."

The apartment is one room pretending to be a life. Simera looks at it the way she always does when she first wakes up—hoping it's changed, hoping the walls have somehow expanded in the night like lungs taking a breath, hoping it's become something other than what it is. But walls don't lie the way people do. Walls just stand there and tell the truth with their peeling paint and their water stains and their absolute indifference to your hoping. Four walls. Twelve paces north to south. Nine paces east to west. One window facing an alley so narrow that light only reaches their floor for exactly forty-seven minutes each afternoon, assuming the sun is even out, which it rarely is. The light comes and goes like a rumor of better things, like a memory of warmth, like something that exists elsewhere but not here, never quite here.

The bed takes up one corner, mattress directly on the floor because they sold the frame six weeks ago. Sold it to a man who didn't ask questions, who paid cash, who carried it down three flights of stairs while they watched from the window and pretended they weren't watching themselves disappear piece by piece. A sheet, wrinkled as an old man's hands, as skin that's given up, covers it. One pillow. They take turns using it. Tonight will be Liz's turn, which means Simera will fold a towel under her head and pretend it's comfortable, pretend comfort is still something available to her. The device sits on the floor beside the mattress, small and silver and innocuous, the wire coiled next to it like a snake digesting something it shouldn't have swallowed, something still struggling in its belly.

The kitchen is three steps from the bed: a hot plate on top of a mini-fridge, a sink full of dishes they've been meaning to wash for three days, a cabinet containing two mugs, three plates, four forks, one knife, and a jar of instant coffee that's more dust than grounds at this point. Simera counts these things without meaning to. The numbers settle into her chest like stones, weighing her down, anchoring her. The numbers never lie. The numbers never change unless you make them change.

"You okay?" Liz asks.

"Yeah."

"That's a lie."

"I know."

Liz's hair is still messy from sleep, dark and wild, sticking up at angles that defy physics and good sense. She's wearing Simera's shirt—a faded gray thing that says something about a concert neither of them attended—and her legs are bare underneath, feet tucked under her on the mismatched chair. One chair came from the street. The other they stole from a laundromat that went out of business. Simera counts the cigarette burns on the armrest: eleven. Small perfect circles like bullet wounds in wood.

"How long was I under?" Simera asks.

Liz glances at the phone on the table between them. The screen is cracked—not spiderweb cracks like the mug but three clean lines that divide the display into unequal territories, like borders on a map of a war no one's winning. "Forty-two minutes. You always go for the long ones."

Forty-two minutes of falling. Forty-two minutes of dying that never quite finishes. Forty-two minutes of being someone else, living someone else's end, feeling someone else's terror and ecstasy bleeding together until they're indistinguishable, until they're the same thing, until fear and pleasure share the same face and you can't tell which one is kissing you. And here, in the apartment, in reality, in the gray light of morning struggling to become afternoon, only forty-two minutes passed. Less than an hour. Less than the time it takes to cook a real meal, to watch a show, to have a conversation about anything that matters, to live even the smallest portion of an actual life.

But in there, in the fall, suspended between building and ground, between being and unbeing, it felt like hours. It felt like forever. It felt like the only time she'd ever truly been alive, which is the cruelest joke of all—that living feels most real when you're dying, that existence only becomes vivid when it's borrowed, when it's not even yours.

"You were sweating so much I thought about calling someone," Liz continues, her voice deliberately casual, the way she always is when she's actually worried. "Your heart rate was crazy. I could see your pulse in your neck."

"But you didn't call."

"But I didn't call."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. I'm an enabler. That's what my therapist would say if I had a therapist. Or money. Or health insurance that covers mental health, which, spoiler alert, doesn't exist in our tax bracket."

Simera almost smiles. This is how Liz deals with everything—wrap it in irony, coat it in sarcasm, make it into a joke before it can become something that hurts, before it can become something you have to actually feel. It's a defense mechanism. It's armor made of words. It's also the only thing that makes this apartment, this poverty, this grinding daily humiliation of being alive bearable. The only thing that keeps them both from counting the ways out, the floors down, the methods of never waking up again.

"How's your stomach?" Simera asks.

Liz's face doesn't change but something flickers behind her eyes—a shadow passing over a landscape, brief and brutal. Pain, maybe. Or the memory of pain. Or the anticipation of pain. When you live with chronic pain, Simera has learned, you're always in one of those three states—hurting, remembering hurt, waiting for hurt to return. Never just free of it. Never just fine. Never just present in your body without your body reminding you that it's a prison, that it's failing, that it has teeth and knows how to use them.

"It's fine," Liz says. The lie is gentle. The lie is familiar. The lie is what keeps them both pretending.

"That's a lie."

"I know." A small smile. "But it's a kind lie. And kind lies are what we have left."

The window behind Liz frames her in gray light—morning trying to become afternoon but not quite succeeding. The alley beyond is empty except for a dumpster and the kind of trash that never quite makes it into the dumpster: broken furniture, bags splitting open to spill their guts, a shopping cart with three wheels lying on its side like a dead animal. Simera counts the pieces of visible furniture: one chair, two boxes, three planks of wood, four—

"Stop," Liz says quietly.

Simera's eyes snap back to her girlfriend. "Sorry."

"Stop apologizing. Just be here with me. Just for a minute. Just be present."

Present. As if presence is something simple. As if being here, in this body, in this room, in this life that feels like it's happening to someone else, is somehow easier than being in a Memento where everything is clear and intense and makes sense in a way that reality never does, never has, never will. But Simera nods. Drinks her coffee. Tries to taste it instead of counting the swallows. Tries to be here, to be now, to be the person Liz deserves instead of the person she's becoming. Fails. Four swallows. The number arrives unbidden, unwelcome, undeniable.

"I need to take a shower," Simera says, standing. The chair scrapes against the floor—linoleum so old it's worn through to the concrete underneath in places. Five places. She counted them last week.

"We don't have hot water until three," Liz reminds her.

"I know."

"So you're going to take a cold shower."

"I guess."

"That's very protagonist of you. Very suffering-artist. Very—" Liz waves her hand, searching for the word, "—aesthetic."

This time Simera does smile, small and brief as a match flaring in darkness. "Shut up."

"Make me."

The bathroom is barely big enough for one person. Barely big enough for the idea of a person. A toilet, a sink, a shower stall with a curtain that doesn't quite close all the way, that leaves a gap where water escapes, where privacy becomes theoretical. Mold grows in the corners—not the black dangerous kind, just the gray kind that makes everything look tired, that makes everything look like it's given up, like it's surrendered to entropy and found peace in decay. The mirror above the sink is spotted with age, silvering flaking off at the edges like skin peeling after a burn. Simera looks at herself and counts the details: two dark circles under her eyes like bruises from a fight she doesn't remember, three freckles across her nose that used to be cute and now just look like imperfections, four lines around her mouth that weren't there a year ago, that mark the passage of time in small cruel increments.

She looks like herself.

She doesn't look like the face in the puddle, the face she saw right before she would have hit the ground, right before the kiss would have ended. Sharp cheekbones cutting angles in skin. Dark, dark eyes that have seen the ground rushing up and chosen to look anyway. A stranger's face. A creator's face. Someone brave enough or broken enough to record their own death and sell it. Someone who jumps off buildings for money, who turns terror into currency, who has learned to monetize the one thing everyone fears. Someone who probably has more than one room, more than twelve paces by nine, more than a door for a table and a mattress on the floor. Someone who has found a way out, even if the way out looks like falling.

Simera plugs the jack into the port behind her ear and feels the connection click home. The sensation is familiar, intimate—metal finding metal, circuit completing circuit. The port is clean—she keeps it clean, cleans it every day with the antiseptic solution they can't really afford but buy anyway because infections are more expensive than prevention, because the port is permanent, embedded in bone, part of her skull now. The metal rim is slightly raised from her skin, a small circular intrusion just behind her right ear where the skull curves down toward the neck. Everyone has them now. They install them when you're born. Standard procedure. Part of being human in this world: come into it ready to plug in, ready to be someone else, ready to consume other people's lives. Come into the world with a socket in your skull, a hole where experience can be poured in, where other people's memories can overwrite your own.

But she's not plugging in. She's just checking. Making sure the connection is clean. Making sure everything works. Just checking.

She unplugs it. Washes her face. The water is cold—the hot won't come on for hours yet—but she splashes it on anyway. Counts the splashes: seven. The cold shocks her awake, makes her gasp, makes her skin feel real and immediate and present. Makes her wish she was still falling.

When she comes out, Liz is doing something on her phone. Her face has that particular expression—concentrated, slightly guilty, the face she makes when she's working.

"Scam?" Simera asks.

"Investigation," Liz corrects without looking up. "I'm investigating opportunities."

"Uh huh."

"I'm doing research into the redistribution of wealth from those who can afford to lose it to those who need it more."

"So a scam."

"Such an ugly word." Liz finally looks up, grinning. "I prefer 'creative fundraising.'"

This is the other thing about Liz: she's a scammer. Not a good one—she's too small-time, too risk-averse, too concerned with only taking from people who, in her estimation, deserve to be taken from. But she's clever. She can find the angles. She can spin a story. She can look at a system and see exactly where the cracks are, where the vulnerabilities live, where the money is supposed to flow and how to redirect it, just a little, just enough to keep them fed for another week.

"What is it this time?" Simera asks.

"Rebate scam. There's this appliance company that offers mail-in rebates, right? But they make the process so complicated that like sixty percent of people never complete it. So I'm completing it. For people. Lots of people. People who don't exist." She looks up, eyes bright with the particular satisfaction of finding an angle, exploiting a crack in the system. "Fake names, fake addresses, real products. They set up the barriers, I climb them. It's beautiful in its own way."

"That seems complicated."

"It is complicated. That's why it works. That's why they do it—hoping people will give up. But I don't give up. I'm persistent. Stubborn. Absurdly committed to meaningless tasks." Liz's fingers fly across the cracked screen. "I'm like Sisyphus, except instead of pushing a boulder up a hill, I'm filling out fake rebate forms. Same principle. Same pointless repetition. Same metaphor for existence. At least Sisyphus got exercise."

"That's very absurdist of you."

"I am nothing if not committed to my philosophy."

Simera sits back down at the table-door. The bills are still there, still waiting. She doesn't want to count them but she does anyway: seventeen envelopes. Three red. Red means overdue. Red means disconnect notice. Red means running out of time.

"We can't keep doing this," Simera says quietly.

Liz's fingers pause on her phone. "Doing what?"

"This. Barely surviving. Scrambling for scraps. You doing fake rebates. Me—" She gestures at the device sitting on the floor by the bed. "—paying to escape into other people's lives because our own is too depressing to stay in."

"Your life," Liz corrects gently. "I don't use Mementos, remember? I'm stuck in my own head, in my own body, all the time. Lucky me."

"That's not what I meant."

"I know what you meant." Liz sets her phone down, screen facing the door-table. "But what's the alternative? We're doing what we can. I'm pulling in a few hundred here and there. You're working whatever jobs you can find. We're surviving. That counts for something."

"Does it?"

"Has to. Otherwise what's the point?"

Simera looks at her girlfriend—really looks at her. Liz is thin, has always been thin, but lately she's gotten thinner. The shirt hangs off her shoulders. Her collarbones are too pronounced. Her wrists look breakable. The stomach pain makes it hard for her to eat, and the medication they can afford isn't strong enough to really help, just enough to take the edge off on the worst days.

"When's the last time you ate a real meal?" Simera asks.

"When's the last time you did?"

"That's not an answer."

"It's my answer."

They look at each other across the door-table. Simera counts the seconds: five, six, seven. Liz breaks first, smiling that crooked smile that made Simera fall in love with her in the first place, back when falling felt like a choice instead of inevitability.

"We're quite a pair, aren't we?" Liz says. "You with your brain plugged into a fantasy machine, living other people's deaths because your life isn't worth staying in. Me with my stomach eating itself from the inside out, like I'm being devoured by my own body. Both of us pretending we're okay when we're obviously, profoundly, catastrophically not."

"That's very bleak."

"I'm a realist."

"You're an absurdist."

"Same thing, really. Same conclusion, different attitude." Liz leans back in her chair. The stolen chair. The chair that used to belong to someone else, somewhere else, some life that had a laundromat and people who did laundry instead of wearing the same clothes until they fell apart. "The universe is meaningless and cruel, but you can laugh while it crushes you. You can make jokes while it grinds you down. That's my whole deal. That's the philosophy. Sisyphus, but make it funny." She stands, stretches, her shirt riding up to reveal her stomach. Simera can count her ribs. Four visible on each side. Eight ribs total. Like bars on a cage made of bone. "You want breakfast?"

"We have breakfast?"

"We have half a loaf of bread and something that might be butter or might be a science experiment. So, yes, in the loosest possible definition of the word, we have breakfast."

The bread is stale. The butter is definitely butter, but it's that weird consistency that suggests it's been left out too long. They eat anyway. Two slices each. Simera counts the bites: thirteen to finish both slices. The bread sticks in her throat but she swallows it down. Calories are calories. Survival is survival.

"I have a phone interview at two," Simera says. "Customer service position. Remote."

"That's good."

"It pays minimum wage."

"That's less good."

"They need someone who can work overnight shifts."

"That's actively bad."

"It's something."

Liz chews her bread slowly, carefully, like each bite has to be negotiated with her stomach. "You going to take it? If they offer?"

"Probably. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe." Simera pushes crumbs around on her plate. White ceramic with a blue rim. Three chips in the rim. "It's not enough. Even if I get it, even if you keep doing your creative fundraising, it's not enough. We're still going to be here, in this room, eating stale bread and pretending it's okay."

"It is okay," Liz says, but her voice is soft, uncertain in a way that Liz rarely is. "It's not great. It's not what we wanted. But it's okay. We have each other. That counts for something."

Simera wants to believe her. Wants to believe that love is enough, that connection matters more than money, that as long as they have each other they can survive anything. But the falling Memento is still in her head, still in her body, and in that fall she felt something that love has never given her: absolute freedom, absolute intensity, absolute escape from the grinding certainty that tomorrow will be exactly like today, that next week will be exactly like this week, that they'll still be here in a year, in five years, in ten, counting the cracks in mugs and the bills they can't pay and the pieces of themselves they've sold to keep breathing.

"I should get ready for the interview," Simera says.

She stands. Liz stands. They meet in the middle of the room—six paces from the door-table, seven from the bed, nine from the window, meeting in the exact center of their small shared prison. They stand there, close enough to touch but not touching, just existing in proximity, just breathing the same air in this room that never has enough air, two people in one room trying to be enough for each other and failing, both of them knowing it and neither saying it, because saying it would make it true in a way it isn't true yet, in a way they can still pretend to avoid.

Then Liz closes the distance and kisses her.

It's soft. Brief. Gentle in a way the world is never gentle. Her lips taste like stale bread and coffee and something underneath that's just Liz, just the specific flavor of this person that Simera has loved for three years, has lived with for two, has been slowly drowning with for the last six months. The kiss is real. Present. Immediate. Nothing like the wind that tore her clothes away. Nothing like falling through air that became solid and visceral. Nothing like the consumption of a Memento where sensation is cranked to impossible heights and every nerve is screaming and everything feels like the last thing you'll ever feel, like the most important thing you'll ever feel, like the only thing worth feeling.

This kiss is just a kiss. Just Liz. Just real. Just human.

It's not enough.

The thought arrives like a betrayal. Like a small death. Like the truth always arrives—unwelcome and undeniable.

The thought comes unbidden and unwelcome, but Simera can't unfeel it. Can't unknow it. Can't pretend it isn't true, isn't the truest thing she's felt all morning. The kiss is nice. The kiss is safe. The kiss is the kind of thing that normal people in normal relationships do to show affection, to prove they still care, to maintain the illusion that love alone can save you from drowning. But nice and safe and normal aren't what Simera wants anymore. Aren't what she needs. She wants to fall. She wants to die without dying. She wants to feel that terrible rushing wind and the certainty of ending and the kiss that never concludes, that builds and builds and cuts away right before consummation, leaving you gasping, leaving you wanting, leaving you hungry for more.

Liz pulls back. Her eyes search Simera's face, looking for something, finding its absence. "You're not here," she says quietly. Not angry. Not even disappointed. Just stating fact. Just naming truth.

"I am."

"You're not. You're somewhere else. Probably falling off a building. Probably dying. Probably anywhere but here with me in this shitty apartment drinking shitty coffee pretending we have a future."

"Liz—"

"It's okay." But her voice says it's not okay. Her voice says nothing is okay and hasn't been okay for a long time and they're both just waiting to see who admits it first. "I get it. I do. This—" She gestures at the apartment, at the poverty surrounding them like water, like flood, like drowning, "—isn't exactly compelling. I don't blame you for wanting to be somewhere else. Someone else. For wanting to be anyone but the person who lives here, who survives this, who wakes up every day to this same room and this same hopelessness and this same slow death that never quite finishes. I'd want that too, if I let myself."

"But you don't."

"But I don't." Liz steps back, puts space between them again. Physical distance. Emotional distance. The kind of distance that starts small and grows until you can't remember being close. Her face has that careful neutrality she wears when she's hurt but won't admit it, when she's bleeding but won't show the wound. "I choose to be here. In this body. In this mess. In this pain. It's a choice I make every day. Every hour, sometimes. To be present. To stay. To not escape."

The implication hangs in the air between them like smoke, like poison, like truth: unlike you.

Simera wants to argue. Wants to defend herself. Wants to explain that it's not about choosing to leave, it's about needing to survive, and sometimes survival looks like escape, and sometimes escape is the only thing keeping you alive long enough to find a real way out. But the words tangle in her throat and what comes out instead is: "I'm sorry."

"Stop apologizing."

"I don't know what else to say."

"Then don't say anything." Liz picks up her phone from the door-table. "I need to finish these forms. You need to prepare for your interview. We both need to pretend we're functional adults for a few hours. So let's just do that."

Simera nods. Liz returns to the table. The conversation is over, not because it's finished but because continuing would require saying things neither of them is ready to say, admitting things neither of them wants to admit. So they retreat into the familiar routine of avoidance, of coexistence without confrontation, of love that's become less about passion and more about shared survival.

The apartment is quiet except for the sound of Liz's fingers on her phone screen and the distant noise of the city beyond their window—sirens, traffic, other people's lives grinding forward. Simera sits on the bed and opens her own phone. 

She doesn't mean to, but she opens the Memento app. Or maybe she does mean to. Maybe the choice was made before she was conscious of making it. Maybe all choices are like that—already decided in the space between neurons firing, in the moment before awareness arrives.

The interface is clean, minimalist. Dark background, white text. Simple. Heri corporation knows what they're doing—make it easy, make it frictionless, make it so you can buy and consume and escape without even thinking about it, without having to acknowledge what you're doing, what you're becoming. The home screen shows recommended Mementos based on her history. The algorithm knows her. Knows what she wants before she wants it. Knows her better than she knows herself, better than Liz knows her, better than anyone has ever known her. The algorithm doesn't judge. Doesn't ask questions. Just provides. Just feeds.

The intimate ones. The ones she doesn't talk about. The ones Liz doesn't know about, probably knows about but doesn't acknowledge, knows about and pretends not to know because acknowledging would require a conversation neither of them is ready to have. The algorithm has learned. Has figured out what Simera looks for during those nights when Liz is asleep and the apartment is dark and the loneliness becomes something physical, something with teeth, something that needs to be fed or it starts eating you from the inside. The algorithm doesn't judge. Doesn't care that the experiences are always with Asian women, always intense, always bordering on too much, always leaving her gasping and empty and wanting more. The algorithm just provides. Just offers. Just shows her what she wants before she even knows she wants it, before shame can intervene, before conscience can object.

Simera scrolls past them. Not today. Today she's just looking. Just browsing. Just reminding herself that escape is available, always available, just a few taps away and twelve dollars she doesn't have but could borrow from the emergency fund they're not supposed to touch.

There's a banner at the top of the screen: BECOME A CREATOR - EARN 10x YOUR CURRENT INCOME

She's seen it before. Ignored it before. Scrolled past it a hundred times, a thousand times, refusing to acknowledge what it offered, what it promised, what it cost. But today, with seventeen bills on the table and three of them red, with a job interview for minimum wage in four hours, with Liz getting thinner and her medication getting scarcer and the walls of the apartment closing in like a fist, like a throat, like a coffin that isn't ready to bury you yet but is measuring you for the space, today she taps it.

The screen changes. The decision is made. The door opens.

MEMENTO CREATORS: TURN YOUR LIFE INTO INCOME

A video autoplays, muted. A young woman—maybe twenty-five, maybe younger—standing on a balcony overlooking a city. Not this city. A better city. Cleaner. Brighter. The camera pans to show the apartment behind her: huge, modern, floor-to-ceiling windows, furniture that's actually furniture instead of salvaged trash. The woman is smiling. She's wearing clothes that fit, that look new, that suggest a life where shopping is something you do for pleasure instead of necessity.

Simera unmutes it. Leans in. Listens to the promise, the lie, the truth that might be both.

"—never thought I could make this much," the woman is saying. Her voice is bright, confident, the voice of someone who has solved the problem of living. "I mean, I was working three jobs, barely making rent. Eating ramen. Choosing between electricity and food. Sound familiar?" A knowing smile. She knows her audience. She was her audience. "Then I started creating Mementos. Nothing crazy at first, just documenting interesting experiences. A hike. A concert. Normal stuff. Then I realized people want more. They want intensity. They want what they can't have. What they're too afraid to do themselves. So I gave it to them." She laughs, gestures at the apartment behind her—huge, modern, impossible. "This is my life now. I create content people want to experience. And Heri takes care of the rest. Distribution, payment, everything. I just live. And I get paid for it."

The video cuts to statistics:
- Average creator income: $4,700/month
- Top creators: $15,000+/month  
- Sign-up bonus: $200 for your first uploaded Memento
- You own your content
- You choose your boundaries
- You control your life

You control your life.

Simera reads it again. And again. Five times. The words burrow into her brain like parasites, like hope, like the worst kind of poison—the kind that tastes like medicine, that promises cure while it kills you. You control your life. The lie is beautiful. The lie is seductive. The lie feels like truth when you want it badly enough, when the alternative is drowning, when control has been absent so long that even its illusion looks like salvation. As if control is something that exists. As if agency is something available to people like her, people in one-room apartments with seventeen unpaid bills and one pillow between two people and love that's not enough to pay for food. As if choosing to sell your experiences, your body, your willingness to be hurt or scared or degraded is somehow different from selling your labor, your time, your dignity to some faceless corporation that pays minimum wage and demands overnight shifts and takes your life hour by hour instead of all at once.

"You looking at porn?"

Simera jumps. Liz is leaning against the bathroom doorframe, arms crossed, eyebrow raised.

"No," Simera says, too quickly.

"Then what's with the guilty face?"

Simera turns her phone screen off. "Nothing. Just browsing."

Liz doesn't move from the doorframe. Just watches. She's good at watching, at seeing things Simera doesn't want seen. It's one of the things that makes their relationship work and one of the things that makes it hard.

"Job interview is at two," Simera says, changing the subject. "I should review the company information."

"You should."

"I will."

"Okay."

But neither of them moves. They just stay there—Simera on the bed, Liz in the doorway, the phone between them like a secret, like a confession, like a decision that hasn't been made yet but is already forming, already crystallizing into inevitability.

Finally, Liz pushes off the doorframe. "I'm going to the corner store. We need milk. And toilet paper. And about seventeen other things we can't afford. I'll get the milk and toilet paper and make up an excuse about why we don't have money for the rest."

"You don't have to—"

"I know I don't have to. I'm choosing to. See? Choice. Agency. The illusion of control in a fundamentally chaotic universe." She grabs her jacket—denim, worn through at the elbows, three sizes too big. Found it in a free bin. "Be back in twenty minutes."

Then she's gone. The door closes with a sound like finality. Like an ending.

Simera sits in the quiet apartment and counts: four walls, twelve paces, nine paces, seventeen bills, three red, one girlfriend who's too thin, one stomach eating itself, one minimum wage job interview, one Memento app with a banner that promises control.

She opens her phone again.

BECOME A CREATOR

She reads the testimonials. The success stories. The people who were broke and desperate and drowning and found a way out. Found a way to take their lives—their experiences, their bodies, their willingness to do things other people won't do—and monetize it. Turn suffering into currency. Turn sensation into income. Turn the desperate need for money into a product people will pay for.

It makes sense. It's logical. It's the exact same thing everyone else is doing—selling themselves, piece by piece, hour by hour, only this is more honest. More direct. You want to see someone fall off a building? Here, pay me, I'll fall off a building. You want to feel what dying feels like? Here, pay me, I'll die for you. Not really die. Not permanently. Just die enough that you can experience it, consume it, make it yours for forty-two minutes.

Simera thinks about the woman in the video. The apartment. The balcony. The smile that suggested safety, security, the kind of life where food is always available and bills get paid and you don't have to count the cracks in mugs because you can afford new mugs, can afford to throw away the broken ones.

She thinks about Liz, getting thinner, pain eating her from the inside because they can't afford the medication that works.

She thinks about the fall. The wind. The moment before impact. How alive she felt. How free.

She thinks about the face in the puddle. The stranger's face. The creator's face. Someone who sells their death. Someone who's probably sitting in an apartment like the one in the video, comfortable, safe, free in a way that Simera has only experienced in Mementos.

The choice forms itself. Not today. Not right now. But soon. The seed is planted. The door is open. The possibility exists where it didn't before.

Simera closes the app. Sets her phone down. Lies back on the mattress that smells like sleep and sweat and the slow decay of hope. Stares at the ceiling. The ceiling stares back, indifferent, marked with water stains like maps of countries that don't exist, like territories no one wants to claim. She counts them: nine major stains. Counts the cracks in the plaster: twenty-six. Counts the minutes until Liz comes back: approximately eighteen. Counts because counting is the only thing that makes sense, because numbers don't lie, because numbers are the only truth available in a world made of deception.

Counts the reasons not to become a creator: one. Liz. Just Liz. Just the woman she loves who's too thin and in too much pain and trying too hard to make dignity out of degradation, trying too hard to stay present in a body that's betraying her, in a life that's failing both of them.

Is one reason enough?

Is love enough?

Has it ever been?

Simera closes her eyes and tries to find the answer. Tries to think clearly, rationally, like a person who has choices instead of just necessities disguised as choices. But all she can feel is the phantom sensation of falling, the wind like a kiss that never ended, the ground rushing up to meet her like a lover, like an ending, like the only honest thing left in a dishonest world. All she can see behind her closed eyelids is that face in the puddle—dark eyes that have seen death, sharp cheekbones cut by wind and velocity, a stranger who looks more like her than her own reflection does, more like the person she's becoming than the person she's been.

All she can think is: what if?

What if control is possible? What if it's not an illusion? What if selling yourself is the only way to own yourself?

What if there's a way out of this room, this poverty, this slow death?

What if falling could save them instead of breaking them? What if the thing she's most afraid of is also the thing that could rescue them both?

The questions sit in her chest like stones. Heavy. Undeniable. Growing heavier with each breath.

Outside, the city continues its grinding forward motion, indifferent to her crisis, indifferent to everyone's crisis, because cities don't care and never have. Inside, Simera lies on a mattress on the floor in a one-room apartment and counts the seconds until something has to change, until something breaks, until the tension becomes unbearable and action becomes inevitable. The numbers climb: sixty, one hundred and twenty, three hundred, six hundred. She counts them all. The numbers never lie. The numbers are the only truth.

The numbers say they're running out of time. Have run out. Are already in the red, already past due, already drowning.

The numbers say choices are being made whether she acknowledges them or not, in the space between heartbeats, in the silence between words.

The numbers say: seventeen bills, three red, one girlfriend getting thinner, one stomach eating itself, one job interview that won't pay enough, one life that's not working, one chance.

The numbers say: fall.

The numbers say: you're already falling. You've been falling since you woke up. Maybe longer. Maybe your whole life has been one long fall and you're only now realizing it, only now understanding that you can choose to be paid for it.

So she does. Not physically. Not yet. Not today. But in her mind, in her future, in the space between now and the inevitable that's approaching like ground after a long fall, she's already stepping off the edge. Already spreading her arms. Already feeling the wind. Already becoming someone else. Already transforming into what necessity demands: a creator. A product. A commodity. A person who sells sensation because sensation is all she has left to sell, because her body and her willingness to risk it are the only assets poverty hasn't already taken.

The apartment is quiet. The ceiling doesn't answer. The water stains don't judge.

And when Liz comes home twenty-three minutes later—not twenty, not eighteen, but twenty-three, Simera counted—with milk and toilet paper and a tired smile that doesn't reach her eyes, that hasn't reached her eyes in months, Simera smiles back and helps put things away and doesn't mention the app or the banner or the decision that's forming like a storm system, inevitable and destructive and absolutely necessary. Doesn't mention that she's already falling. Doesn't mention that the ground is rushing up. Doesn't mention that this time, she's going to get paid for it.

Some things you keep to yourself.

Some falls you take alone.

Some decisions don't need to be made today because they've already been made, in the space between heartbeats, in the counting of cracks, in the silence between words where the truth lives before you're ready to speak it, before you're ready to acknowledge that you've chosen, that the choice was made the moment you saw the face in the puddle, the moment you felt the wind, the moment you realized that dying feels more real than living ever has.

Simera knows what she's going to do.

She's known since she saw the face in the puddle, the stranger's face, the creator's face, the face that might be hers if she's brave enough or desperate enough or broken enough.

She's known since she felt the wind, since the kiss, since the moment before impact when everything became clear and simple and true.

She's known since she counted the bills and counted the ribs and counted the days until something breaks, until someone breaks, until they both break.

She's going to fall.

Not today. But soon. Very soon. The countdown has already started, the numbers climbing, the ground rushing up.

And this time, she's going to get paid for it.

This time, the fall will save them.

This time, dying will keep them alive.

The apartment is quiet. Liz hums something in the kitchen—off-key, melancholy, beautiful in the way broken things are beautiful when you love them. Simera closes her eyes and counts: one girlfriend, one decision, one fall, one chance, one life that's ending and another that might begin if she's willing to jump, if she's willing to become what the world demands, if she's willing to sell the only thing she has left.

The numbers never lie.

The numbers say: fall.

So she will.
