# Chapter 13: Together

## Chapter Summary
Simera and Liz have established a pattern: they use Mementos together. Sometimes. Not all the time, they tell themselves. Just occasionally. It feels like connection—experiencing things together, sharing the intensity, being present in each other's experiences. They choose calmer ones at first, safe ones. Walking tours, nature scenes, peaceful content. But slowly, subtly, the intensity escalates. Liz discovers what Simera already knew: the calm ones aren't enough. They're boring. Empty. The intensity calls. They start choosing more extreme content together. Falling Mementos. Dangerous experiences. Sexual content. The shared experience creates false intimacy—they think they're connecting, but they're actually both numbing, both fragmenting, both descending together. And Liz is escalating faster than Simera did. Where Simera took months to crave intensity, Liz seems to need more within weeks. Her addiction is faster, deeper, more consuming. Simera notices with growing dread, but says nothing because she's using too, because they're doing it together, because stopping Liz would mean stopping herself. The chapter shows them over time, the pattern establishing, the escalation happening, both of them pretending it's okay because they're together.

## Character Focus
- **Liz**: Escalating rapidly, addiction deepening faster than Simera's did, needing intensity, fragmenting
- **Simera**: Noticing Liz's escalation, worried but enabling, using together as excuse not to intervene, beginning to see Liz is worse off

## Themes to Explore
- Shared descent as false intimacy
- How addiction together feels like connection
- Escalation as inevitable
- Different speeds of addiction
- Enabling disguised as partnership
- The illusion of control through togetherness
- How love makes us blind to destruction
- The comfort of mutual decline

## Atmosphere & Tone
The false warmth of togetherness masking cold descent. Moments of perceived intimacy that are actually shared numbness. The acceleration of Liz's addiction should feel ominous. Time passing, pattern establishing, point of no return approaching. The reader should feel mounting dread.

## Writing Notes
- Show the time passing—weeks, months
- Multiple scenes of them using together
- Start with safe content, show the escalation
- Make the false intimacy feel real to them but hollow to reader
- Liz's faster descent should be gradual but clear
- Simera's growing concern shown subtly
- Her inability to intervene because she's doing it too
- The hypocrisy trap
- Show both their OCD/mental states worsening
- The pattern should feel established and unstoppable
- End with clear signal: Liz is more addicted than Simera
- This sets up the role reversal completing in next chapters
