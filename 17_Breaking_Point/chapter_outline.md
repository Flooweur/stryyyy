# Chapter 17: Breaking Point

## Chapter Summary
The crisis. Something happens that forces confrontation with reality. Maybe Simera gets physically hurt during a recording and the real consequences break through her dissociation. Maybe Liz reaches her breaking point. Maybe Simera has a moment of clarity about what she's become. Or maybe she does something while dissociated that she discovers afterward. The moment where something breaks—the pattern, the relationship, the self, or all of the above. The horror fully conscious now. The recognition of loss.
