Understand the writing style of Fabien Vehlmann, Cormac McCarthy, Victor Hugo and Antoine de St Exupéry in depth and use the best part of all of them when writing.
I don't want to find parts of the inspirations into the story you will write but it should be it's own story, as a blend of the writing style of the mentioned authors.
Make it a prize worthy story.
Make sure the chapters are impactful, this is not a race so take your time to do descriptions in their fullest and their most beautiful form.

Core idea:
- We see Simera and her girlfriend Liz struggling to make money, to get by.
- Simera doing small work, slowly sowing the seeds of her thinking about creating Mementos.
- Story about a world in which the company "Heri" exists.
- This is a company that sells memories (Mementos) that a person recorded and that allows someone to live it again.
- On the technical side, you can buy Mementos on a sort of streaming platform on your smartphone, plug it into a jack behind your ear and start playing it.
- It overwrites everything that happens in the brain to make the user feel like they are truly living the experience.
- In this world there are the people consuming those memories and the ones creating them, putting themselves in extremely dangerous or depraved situations.
- Oftentimes, the more dangerous or depraved the situation is, the more Heri is willing to pay for those memories. (Ot the more expensive they can be on alternative markets).
- The protagonist will be named "Simera".
- Simera have some slight OCD, keep it subtle, she can't help but count everything (chairs in a room, windows on a wall, etc...), it gets worse when she is stressed.
- The protagonist's girlfriend is "Liz". She suffers from chronic stomach pain and has to take some powerful painkillers to alleviate that from time to time (she is duller when under the influence of her painkillers).
- I want Liz to not use the Memento system out of principle, but she doesn't guilt Simera about that, she is a scam with some wit, she is a bit of a pathetic scammer but i'd like her to be really good at finding justifications for what she does, some of the plot could revolve around Simera losing more and more sensibility and her girlfriend is here to remind us of that. The losing of sensibility could be seen in their relationship (no pleasure from mundane moments, sexual intercourse, etc… (Bonus if there is a sex scene that is really beautiful and symbolizes that))
- I want the story to start in medias res, with Simera being on the edge of a skyscraper, she takes a breath in and jumps, free diving to the bottom (the reader doesn't know it yet but she is "playing" a Memento), the scenes is beautiful, she starts in a hospital gown and she just ends up naked as she falls, free.
- This scene should be a very intimate description, using a very passionate kiss as a metaphor for her feeling the fall and approaching the ground, make it sensual, desirable, intense but do not use sexual vocabulary, instead i want you to really describe the sensations to imply sexuality without mentioning it.
- The fall scene cuts the moment she is about to touch the ground, it needs to put the reader in a very tense mood already. Then we see Simera in her bed, pale and sweaty, coming out of the memory. Her girlfriend (Liz) is sitting next to her, toying with a small machine she is preparing for a scam, she turns and tells her that it looked like this one was really intense.
- Simera wants to get into creating memories, taking on more and more hardcore scenarios (in a wide range of "genres"). Not sure but at some she could start selling illegal scenarios to the black market on the side.
- It should not be said but some stuff about Simera could be shown through the kind of Mementos she likes to use (following the show don’t tell, we could see her preferences like for example she hase a big preference for mementos of falling and of sexual intercourse specifically with asian women (one on one, orgies, ...))
- There could be a whole black market of illegal memories (murder, drugs, violence, etc...) that could be interesting to explore in the story.
- I want the girlfriend to have an absurdist view on the world (shown not told), clashing with the increasingly nihilist view of Simera.
- Someone using a Memento doesn't know they are using a memento while they are in the experience since the machine overwrite all of the cognitive functions.
- There could be a chapter that is ambiguous, where we don't know if Simera is playing a memento or not in a very clever way.
- Fluid natural transitions (why did she start wanting to create, maybe seeing how some people become super wealthy and live lavish lives out of the money they make by creating. Kinda like the pressure to post on social media that’s created by stuff like tiktok today, or kinda the same way women used to become mistresses in the past because it was their only chance of getting out of poverty)
- The characters choices should feel like actuel people making choices, natural, following their personaliy (this is very important).
- Maybe it could be a thing that the people who are consuming mementos don’t like it as much if the person creating it knows they are creating a memento, because when they consume it they also feel if the person recording the memento know they are recording (less tension). Leading to some memento creators taking dissociation medicines/drugs before creating (it should just be a thing and not the center of the story).
- This could also be a whole commentary on the porn industry and the way it lures people in and they end up doing more and more extreme stuff.
- As the story goes on, stuff/her memories/what she has around her becomes more and more blurry and confusing, showing that she is losing touch more and more, this could be interesting to pace that with her consuming experiences, like at one point she doesn’t recognize where she is because she is in a memento, and later the same happen but it’s her own life. That would be good if the reader is as confused as Simera and may need a second read to really figure out if she is in a memento or not. There will be some horror in figuring what is real and what isn’t.
- This is the most important: This story MUST make me feel, MAKE me dread, MAKE ME FUCKING CRY, MAKE ME BAWL MY EYES OUT, MAKE ME FEEL IT IN MY GUTS
