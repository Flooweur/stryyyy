# Chapter 13: The Blur

## Chapter Summary
Simera's grip on reality beginning to loosen. She uses Mementos frequently (consuming), creates them regularly, and the line between lived experience and recorded memory starts to blur. Moments where she's unsure if something happened or if she experienced it in a Memento. Confusion about whether she's currently in a Memento or reality. The disorientation growing. Her memories fragmenting. Details from her real life and Memento experiences mixing. The horror of losing the ability to distinguish real from recorded. Liz noticing but Simera dismissing her concerns.

## Key Story Beats
- [ ] Simera unable to remember if something was real or a Memento
- [ ] Confusion during a moment - is this real?
- [ ] Memories overlapping and fragmenting
- [ ] Details from Mementos intruding into real memories
- [ ] Disorientation increasing
- [ ] Liz's concern and Simera's dismissal
- [ ] The reader sharing Simera's confusion
- [ ] Reality becoming unreliable

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Disoriented, fragmenting, defensive about it
- **Liz**: Alarmed, trying to ground Simera, increasingly scared

## Themes to Explore
- Loss of reality
- Identity fragmentation
- The cost of living in simulation
- Existential horror
- The unreliable nature of memory

## Atmosphere & Tone
Disorienting, surreal, creeping horror. The ground falling away. Unreliable narration. The reader should feel Simera's confusion and fear. Vertigo.

## Writing Notes
- Make the confusion real for the reader too
- Blur the lines deliberately - don't clarify what's real
- The horror is subtle, creeping, existential
- Simera's denial should be defensive and scared
- Details that don't quite match up
- End with Simera (and reader) genuinely uncertain
