# Chapter 7: Easy Money

## Chapter Summary
The first payment brings relief. Bills get paid. Simera and Liz can breathe for the first time in a while. Maybe they celebrate, go out, buy something small but meaningful. The temporary reprieve feels like salvation. Simera creates a few more Mementos—still relatively tame by market standards. The money flows. It seems manageable, even sustainable. A false sense of control. The comfort is seductive. Simera is good at this. The positive feedback and earnings validate her choice. But there are hints: the content that sells best is more extreme; comments from users wanting more; the algorithm pushing her toward harder content.

## Key Story Beats
- [ ] Financial relief - bills paid, breathing room
- [ ] Small celebration or moment of happiness
- [ ] Several more recordings, establishing a pattern
- [ ] Money coming in regularly
- [ ] Positive feedback from users
- [ ] Life improving materially
- [ ] Hints at market pressure toward extremity
- [ ] Comments/messages requesting more extreme content
- [ ] The algorithm showing what "successful" creators do
- [ ] Simera considering the next step

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Relief, validation, growing confidence, temptation
- **Liz**: Happy for the financial relief, but watchful, noticing small changes

## Themes to Explore
- The seduction of economic security
- How normalization happens gradually
- The market's push toward extremity
- The algorithm as corrupting force
- Temporary comfort masking future cost

## Atmosphere & Tone
Deceptively light. The eye of the storm. Happiness tinged with foreboding. The reader should feel the trap closing even as the characters feel relief.

## Writing Notes
- Show the genuine relief and happiness
- Make the escalation pressure feel organic and market-driven
- Subtle signs that Simera is changing
- Liz noticing things that Simera dismisses
- End with Simera considering crossing the next boundary
