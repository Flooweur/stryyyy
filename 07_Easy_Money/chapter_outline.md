# Chapter 7: Easy Money

## Chapter Summary
The falling Memento's success brings relief and validation. Bills get paid. Simera and Liz can breathe. Maybe they celebrate something small. The temporary reprieve feels like salvation. Simera creates a few more Mementos—some walking tours, another edge-standing recording, building her catalog. The money continues to flow. It seems manageable, even sustainable. A false sense of control. The comfort is seductive. Simera is good at this. The positive feedback and earnings validate her choice. Liz watches with mixed feelings—relief at the financial security but growing concern at what Simera is becoming. But there are hints of pressure: the content that sells best is more extreme; comments from users wanting more; the algorithm pushing her toward harder content. And Simera notices something disturbing: she's thinking about creating again not just for money but because she wants to feel that intensity again.

## Key Story Beats

- [ ] Small celebration or moment of happiness
- [ ] Several more recordings, establishing a pattern

- [ ] Hints at market pressure toward extremity
- [ ] Comments/messages requesting more extreme content

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Relief, validation, growing confidence, temptation
- **Liz**: Happy for the financial relief, but watchful, noticing small changes

## Themes to Explore
- The seduction of economic security
- How normalization happens gradually
- The market's push toward extremity
- The algorithm as corrupting force
- Temporary comfort masking future cost

## Atmosphere & Tone
Deceptively light. The eye of the storm. Happiness tinged with foreboding. The reader should feel the trap closing even as the characters feel relief.

## Writing Notes
- Show the genuine relief and happiness
- Make the escalation pressure feel organic and market-driven
- Subtle signs that Simera is changing
- Liz noticing things that Simera dismisses
- End with Simera considering crossing the next boundary
