## High-Level Narrative Arc

This story follows Simera's descent from consumer to creator of Mementos—recorded experiences sold by the Heri corporation. It's a tragedy of exploitation, identity dissolution, and the cost of commodifying human experience.

## Three-Act Structure

### **ACT I: The World and the Wound** (Chapters 1-7)
**Setup and Escalation into Creation**

- **Ch 1-2**: Opening with the fall Memento (in medias res), then establishing Simera and Liz's world
- **Ch 3-5**: Economic desperation, exposure to creator culture, decision to create
- **Ch 6-7**: First recordings and initial success—the seduction of easy money

### **ACT II: The Descent** (Chapters 8-15)
**Transformation and Loss**

- **Ch 8-9**: Growing emotional numbness, crossing moral boundaries
- **Ch 10**: Introduction to the black market
- **Ch 11-12**: Deep numbness contrasted with Liz's perspective and pain
- **Ch 13-15**: Reality begins to blur, ambiguity sets in, escalation into extreme content

### **ACT III: Dissolution** (Chapters 16-20)
**Breaking Point and Resolution**

- **Ch 16-17**: Complete disconnect from reality, crisis/breaking point
- **Ch 18**: Fragmentation—the self scattered
- **Ch 19**: Moment of terrible clarity and choice
- **Ch 20**: The ending—dissolution complete or attempted redemption (to be determined by your vision)

## Key Narrative Threads

1. **Economic Desperation → Exploitation**: The pipeline from poverty to self-destruction
2. **Simera & Liz's Relationship**: Love confronting loss, presence vs. absence
3. **Reality Blur**: Progressive loss of ability to distinguish real from recorded
4. **Identity Dissolution**: The self as a commodity that can be sold piece by piece
5. **Systemic Critique**: Parallels to social media, pornography industry, late capitalism

## Thematic Resonance

- **Opening (Ch 1)**: The fall as freedom, escape, sensory intensity
- **Middle (Ch 13-14)**: The fall as disorientation, loss of ground
- **Ending (Ch 20)**: The fall as ??? (your choice—final dissolution, acceptance, grace, ambiguity)

## Character Arcs

### Simera
- **Beginning**: Struggling, seeking escape, sensitive to details (OCD), seeking intensity
- **Middle**: Numbing, detaching, losing connection to sensation and reality
- **End**: Dissolved/fragmented/choosing ??? (depends on your vision)

### Liz
- **Constant**: Absurdist philosophy, chronic pain, wit, love for Simera, principled refusal of Mementos
- **Arc**: From supportive partner → concerned observer → witness to dissolution → ??? (her choice about staying/leaving)

## Writing Approach

Following your instructions, this story should:

1. **Blend styles** of Vehlmann (darkness), McCarthy (sparse brutality), Hugo (lyricism), Saint-Exupéry (philosophy)
2. **Show, don't tell**: Characters' traits revealed through action and choice
3. **Long, immersive chapters**: Prioritize beauty and depth
4. **Make readers FEEL**: Dread, sorrow, devastation—emotionally overwhelming
5. **Natural progression**: Characters' choices feel organic to their psychology
6. **Reality blur**: Deliberate ambiguity about what's real vs. Memento
7. **Subtle details**: Simera's OCD (counting), preferences (falling, Asian women, sexual content), growing nihilism

## Next Steps for You

1. Read through each chapter outline
2. Fill in the "Your Notes & Ideas" sections with your thoughts
3. Adjust any chapter summaries that don't match your vision
4. Determine the specifics of the ending (Chapter 20)
5. Begin writing when ready, using these outlines as guides

The structure is flexible—treat these as scaffolding, not prison. If the story demands different choices as you write, follow it.

**Remember**: This story must make you cry. That's the north star. Every chapter should build toward that devastating emotional impact.
