## Writing Approach

Following your instructions, this story should:

1. **Blend styles** of Vehlmann (darkness), McCarthy (sparse brutality), Hugo (lyricism), Saint-Exupéry (philosophy)
2. **Show, don't tell**: Characters' traits revealed through action and choice
3. **Long, immersive chapters**: Prioritize beauty and depth
4. **Make readers FEEL**: Dread, sorrow, devastation—emotionally overwhelming
5. **Natural progression**: Characters' choices feel organic to their psychology
6. **Reality blur**: Deliberate ambiguity about what's real vs. Memento
7. **Subtle details**: Simera's OCD (counting), preferences (falling, Asian women, sexual content), growing nihilism

## Next Steps for You

1. Read through each chapter outline
2. Fill in the "Your Notes & Ideas" sections with your thoughts
3. Adjust any chapter summaries that don't match your vision
4. Determine the specifics of the ending (Chapter 20)
5. Begin writing when ready, using these outlines as guides

The structure is flexible—treat these as scaffolding, not prison. If the story demands different choices as you write, follow it.
