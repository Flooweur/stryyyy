# Chapter 12: The Justification

## Chapter Summary
After Simera discovers Liz using a Memento, they have a difficult conversation. Liz is defensive, justifying her choice with all the same rationalizations Simera used at the beginning: it's just to cope, it's medical really, it helps with the pain, it's just temporary. Simera is concerned—deeply concerned—because she recognizes the pattern, knows where it leads. She tries to talk to Liz about it, tries to express her worry, but Liz bristles at the perceived hypocrisy. "You did it. You still do it. Why can't I?" The fight that erupts isn't angry like before—it's worse. It's sad, defensive, both of them talking past each other. Simera trying to protect Liz from what she knows is coming. Liz feeling judged by someone who has no right to judge. The fight resolves nothing. Liz doesn't stop using Mementos. She continues, justifying each time. And slowly, tragically, Simera finds herself agreeing to use Mementos with Liz sometimes—to monitor her, to be there, to feel less hypocritical, to maintain connection. The chapter ends with them using Mementos together for the first time, a moment that feels like connection but is actually mutual descent.

## Character Focus
- **Liz**: Defensive, justifying, feeling judged, determined to continue, pulling Simera in
- **Simera**: Concerned, hypocritical feeling, recognizing patterns, trying to help, ultimately enabling

## Themes to Explore
- The hypocrisy of warning against what you do yourself
- How we rationalize our own behavior but see clearly in others
- Enabling disguised as support
- Using together as false intimacy
- The descent masked as connection
- How love can lead us to enable destruction
- The cycle perpetuating

## Atmosphere & Tone
Tense, sad, circular arguments, the frustration of recognizing danger but being unable to stop it. The false comfort of using together. The reader should feel the trap closing, see what the characters can't—that this is the beginning of the end.

## Writing Notes
- The conversation should feel real and frustrating
- Liz's defensiveness should be understandable
- Simera's concern should be genuine but undermined by her own use
- The hypocrisy should be visible to both characters and readers
- The decision to use together should feel like compromise but is actually enabling
- Show how using together creates false sense of safety
- Both think they're connecting; reader sees they're descending
- The parallel to earlier chapters should be clear but with role reversal
- This sets up the pattern that will dominate the next chapters
