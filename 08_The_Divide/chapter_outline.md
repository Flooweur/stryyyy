# Chapter 8: The Divide

## Chapter Summary
Small cracks appearing in Simera and Liz's relationship. Simera is different—subtly harder, more detached. Liz notices but Simera denies any change. A beautiful, tragic sex scene that demonstrates Simera's growing numbness—she's physically there but emotionally absent, unable to find pleasure in what used to move her. Liz feels it deeply. Simera doesn't fully recognize what she's losing. After, maybe Liz has an episode of pain, needs her medication, and Simera's response is colder than it would have been before. The contrast between who they were and who they're becoming.
