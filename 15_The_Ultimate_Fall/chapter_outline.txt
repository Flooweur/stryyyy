CHAPTER 15: THE ULTIMATE FALL
==============================

CHAPTER PITCH:
Senna's crew transports the confused and frightened Simera to the roof of a 95-story building under the pretense of a "therapeutic outing," and as they position her wheelchair near the edge claiming they want to show her the city view, new-Simera experiences growing panic sensing something wrong but unable to articulate what because she has no memory of falling or Mementos or choosing death, and when they lift her from the wheelchair and hold her at the precipice she begins screaming and begging and fighting with the limited strength her paralyzed body allows, pure animal terror of someone who desperately wants to live, while Liz watches from behind the cameras that record every moment of authentic fear for the Memento that will be sold to wealthy consumers seeking the ultimate authentic death experience, and as they let Simera go—her screams raw and terrible, her face twisted in incomprehension and terror, reaching out for help that won't come—the chapter cuts between her fall to the ground and Liz experiencing the Memento live through a neural feed, forcing us to witness Simera's death twice, from both sides of the consumption divide, until the moment of impact when both perspectives end in simultaneous blackness, and the final word is simply: "Sold."

"SOLD."

[End chapter]

FINAL NOTE:
This is the climax of horror. New-Simera dies terrified and confused, wanting to live, murdered by old-Simera's choice that she can't remember. Liz witnesses and experiences it, complicit and helpless. The Memento sells. The system continues. Everyone who buys it participates in her murder. Everyone who read this far participated in consuming her death. The horror is complete. The system is exposed. And Simera got what she wanted (to stop existing) but not how she wanted (she died terrified, not peacefully). There is no comfort here. Only the brutal efficiency of a market that turns suffering into product. End with "SOLD" to emphasize: she was product all along. That's what this system does. That's what we watched happen. That's what we consumed. We're all complicit.
