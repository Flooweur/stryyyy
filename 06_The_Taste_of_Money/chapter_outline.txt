CHAPTER 6: THE TASTE OF MONEY
==============================

CHAPTER PITCH:
With 6,500 units burning in her account, Simera and Liz experience a brief window of financial breathing room—they pay three months' rent in advance, buy real food instead of cheap substitutes, get the sink fixed, even purchase new sheets—and for a moment the apartment transforms from a prison into merely a humble home, but the money evaporates faster than expected and Simera finds herself already scheduling her second recording while Liz watches the transformation with growing alarm, recognizing that Simera isn't doing this just for survival anymore but because she's found something in the terror that poverty had stolen from her: the ability to feel anything at all.

EXHAUSTIVE INSTRUCTIONS & IDEAS:

STRUCTURAL FUNCTION (Save the Cat! Beat Sheet):
- This is FUN AND GAMES / PROMISE OF THE PREMISE
- Brief taste of success (false victory)
- Show what the money can do (temporary relief)
- Establish new normal (Simera as creator)
- Seeds of escalation planted
- Relationship dynamics shifting

SCENE STRUCTURE:
1. PAYMENT: Using the money, paying rent
2. SHOPPING: Buying necessities (feels like luxury)
3. APARTMENT IMPROVEMENTS: Small repairs, new items
4. BRIEF HAPPINESS: Moment of relief/normalcy
5. LAPSE: Money running out faster than expected
6. SECOND SCHEDULING: Simera booking next recording
7. LIZ'S CONCERN: Confrontation about motivation
8. TENSION: Growing distance between them
9. PREPARATION: Simera getting ready for second fall

MONEY DETAILS:
- 6,500 - 1,800 rent (3 months) = 4,700
- Food shopping: 800 units
- Sink repair: 350 units
- New sheets, towels: 200 units
- Paying back small debts: 500 units
- Simera buying more Mementos: 1,200 units (!!!!)
- Remaining: 1,650 units
- Two weeks later: down to 800 units
- The math of poverty: you can't save when you start from deficit

BRIEF HAPPINESS MOMENTS:
- Hot water working (small miracle)
- Fresh vegetables instead of instant meals
- Liz laughing at something (rare sound)
- Sleeping without anxiety about rent
- Window to breathe
- But temporary, both know it

THE REVELATION:
- Liz discovers Simera bought MORE Mementos
- "You fell to stop buying these. And now you're buying them again?"
- Simera: "I need to study them. For work."
- Liz: "That's a lie."
- "Maybe. But it's my lie."
- The money meant to save them is feeding the addiction

SECOND RECORDING SCHEDULED:
- Kael calls, offers 40-story fall (higher than first)
- 8,000 units (base rate, could be higher)
- Simera says yes immediately
- Didn't consult Liz
- Didn't hesitate
- The decision already made

LIZ'S CONFRONTATION:
- "You liked it. The falling."
- "I did my job."
- "No. You liked it. I can tell."
- "What if I did? What if it's the only thing I like?"
- "That terrifies me."
- "It should."

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:
SIMERA:
- Brief moment of normalcy feels wrong
- Uncomfortable with stability
- Already craving next fall
- Using money to buy more Mementos (contradiction)
- Defensive about her choices
- Aware she's changing, doesn't care
- The bruises from first fall still visible, already wants more

LIZ:
- Relief at financial breathing room
- Hope that maybe this will be enough
- Then seeing it isn't enough
- Watching Simera change
- Trying to reach her, failing
- Her philosophy (absurdism) challenged by Simera's active nihilism
- Still loving her, losing her

THEMATIC ELEMENTS:
- Money as temporary solution to structural problem
- Addiction transferring (from consumption to creation)
- The insufficiency of financial security when spiritual void exists
- Work as meaning (even destructive work)
- Poverty's long tail (can't save, always catching up)
- Relationship strain under economic/existential pressure

WORLD-BUILDING:
- Cost of living details
- What money can and can't buy
- The creator economy (Simera now part of it)
- Repeat creator patterns
- The normalization of what she's doing

FORESHADOWING:
- Simera's eagerness for second recording (addiction forming)
- The money not lasting (will need more, always more)
- Liz's fear (knows where this leads)
- Simera's contradictions (falling to afford Mementos, buying Mementos with fall money)
- The bruises not fully healed (body not recovered, doesn't matter)

EMOTIONAL BEATS:
- Relief (paying rent)
- Joy (small pleasures)
- Guilt (Simera buying Mementos)
- Anger (Liz's discovery)
- Defensiveness (Simera justifying)
- Fear (Liz recognizing pattern)
- Determination (Simera committing to second fall)
- Resignation (Liz giving up arguing)

KEY IMAGES:
- Money card swiping for rent (landlord's surprise)
- Fresh food in their refrigerator (abundance)
- New white sheets on bed (clean, soft, temporary)
- The Memento machine with new chips (contradiction)
- Liz holding receipt, seeing the Memento purchases
- Simera's bruises fading (body healing, will be damaged again)
- The spider's web with multiple caught prey

AVOID:
- Making the happiness too complete
- Losing the sense of doom
- Making Liz nagging or unsympathetic
- Letting Simera seem crazy rather than addicted
- Forgetting physical reality (bruises, exhaustion)
- Rushing to second fall

CLOSING IMAGE:
- Simera at window, looking toward Heri tower
- "Thursday. Forty stories this time."
- Liz in bed, back turned
- The gap between them now measured in feet
- The new sheets already feeling less new
- Money running out
- The cycle beginning again

FINAL NOTE:
This chapter shows that money alone can't fix what's broken in Simera. The poverty was symptom, not cause. The real void is internal. And falling—both consuming and creating—is the only thing that fills it. End with the sense that this will escalate, must escalate, because once is never enough.
