# Chapter 11: The Breaking

## Chapter Summary
Liz is drowning in depression. Days after discovering what Simera did, she can't escape the guilt and pain. She sees herself as the burden that's destroying Simera. The physical pain continues, but the emotional pain is worse—the knowledge that she's the reason Simera risked death. She can't eat, can't sleep, can't function. Simera tries everything to help, but nothing reaches Liz. One day, when the pain—physical and emotional—becomes unbearable, Liz makes a choice she swore she'd never make. She uses one of Simera's Mementos. Just to escape for a little while. Just to feel something other than this crushing guilt and pain. She chooses something simple, calming—maybe a beach scene, something peaceful. For the duration of the Memento, the pain stops. The guilt stops. She feels... okay. Normal. When she comes back, reality crashes down again, but she's discovered something terrifying: escape is possible. She tells herself it was just once. Just to cope. Just to survive. She starts justifying it the same way Simera did at the beginning. The chapter ends with Liz rationalizing what she's done, and Simera discovering her—horror and concern warring with a terrible understanding of what's beginning.

## Atmosphere & Tone
Dark, suffocating depression giving way to desperate relief. The weight of guilt crushing. The moment of breaking principles feels both terrible and necessary. The escape feels like salvation and damnation. The reader should see the tragic parallel to Simera's beginning. Devastating and inevitable.

- The moment of breaking should be devastating

- The horror of seeing someone you love start down the path you know
- This is the turning point—Liz becomes the addict
