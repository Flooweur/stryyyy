# Chapter 10: The Haunting

## Chapter Summary
Days after the fight with Liz, Simera can't stop thinking about that last recording. The intensity of it. How alive she felt. How every sensation was amplified. The danger made it more real than anything she'd experienced in months. She tries to go back to normal life, but everything feels muted in comparison. Mundane moments with Liz feel hollow. She keeps replaying the memory of the recording in her mind—not the content itself, but the feeling of creating it. The rush. The aliveness. She tells herself it was just adrenaline, just the circumstances, just the fear. But she knows something shifted. She felt something she hadn't felt in a long time, maybe ever. And now normal life feels like waiting. This chapter is internal, psychological—Simera wrestling with this new hunger she doesn't want to acknowledge. She hasn't created again (yet), but the wanting is there, growing.

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Internal conflict, the addiction beginning, denial, self-awareness and self-deception
- **Liz**: Present but distant, their relationship strained, unaware of Simera's obsessive thoughts

## Themes to Explore
- The seduction of intensity
- How exceptional experiences make normal life feel inadequate
- The beginning of addiction
- Self-awareness without self-control
- The hunger for feeling alive
- How we rationalize cravings

## Atmosphere & Tone
Claustrophobic, obsessive, creeping hunger. Internal and psychological. The tension of wanting something you know is destructive. The horror of recognizing yourself becoming addicted. Restless, unsettled.

## Writing Notes
- This is primarily an internal chapter
- Show Simera's obsession through her thoughts returning to it constantly
- Make the craving psychological not just physical
- Show how normal life has lost color/meaning in comparison
- Liz should be present but Simera is increasingly absent
- The reader should feel Simera's growing compulsion
- End with the inevitability that she'll do it again
- This is where the addiction really starts
