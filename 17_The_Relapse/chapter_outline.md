# Chapter 17: The Depths

## Chapter Summary
This chapter deepens the dramatic irony. Simera continues to believe things are improving, continues her own struggle with addiction, tries to support Liz. Meanwhile, Liz's secret use escalates further into dangerous territory. The chapter could show a specific instance where Simera almost discovers the truth—maybe she comes home early, or finds something Liz forgot to hide—but Liz manages to explain it away, and Simera wants to believe, so she does. The lies get more elaborate. Liz is using more extreme, dangerous Mementos—possibly explicitly black market content now. The type of Mementos that come with warnings, that have caused injuries or deaths, that are modified or illegal. Liz is chasing a high that's becoming harder to reach. Her mental state is deteriorating visibly, but when Simera notices and asks, Liz attributes it to the difficulty of withdrawal, to her chronic pain, to anything except the truth. Simera's own struggles with her own addiction make her less observant, less able to see clearly. The chapter builds tension toward the inevitable discovery. It shows just how far Liz has fallen while Simera remained unaware. The danger is extreme now. The reader knows something terrible is coming.

## Character Focus
- **Liz**: Deeper in addiction than ever, using dangerous black market content, lying elaborately, deteriorating, desperate, unable to stop despite knowing the danger
- **Simera**: Trusting, wanting to believe, struggling with her own addiction, missing clear signs, enabled by her own denial

## Themes to Explore
- How far addiction can go in secret
- The danger of extreme/black market content
- Elaborate lies addicts construct
- How we enable through wanting to believe
- The isolation of secret addiction
- Chasing highs that destroy
- The point of no return already passed
- Fragmentation as death of self

## Atmosphere & Tone
Mounting dread, inevitable catastrophe approaching. Liz alone in her descent. Simera's hopeful ignorance increasingly painful. The reader screaming at the page, watching the tragedy unfold, unable to stop it. Dark, ominous, the calm before the storm. Every scene with Liz should feel dangerous now.

## Writing Notes
- Show Liz's extreme/dangerous Memento use clearly
- Make the black market content specific and frightening
- The near-discovery scene should be tense
- Liz's lies should be convincing
- Simera's willingness to believe should be understandable
- Her own addiction makes her blind
- Show Liz's deterioration clearly to reader
- But make Simera's missing it believable
- Plant clear signs of the danger coming
- Foreshadow the modified Memento
- The type that has warnings, has caused problems
- End with sense of imminent catastrophe
- This is the chapter before everything breaks
- Make the reader dread what's coming
