THE DISSOLUTION OF SIMERA
Chapter One: The Fall
The wind does not howl at this height. It whispers. It moves through the scaffolding of her ribs like a lover's fingers trailing downward, patient and deliberate, and she stands barefoot on the lip of concrete where the building ends and the nothing begins.
Below, the city spreads itself like a catalog of human wanting. The lights of it pulse and shimmer, each window a small fire of need, each street a vein carrying the blood of commerce and desire through the body of the metropolis. She does not think of them now, the people in their rooms, the people in their cars like beetles crawling through grooves worn smooth by repetition. She thinks of nothing. This is the trick. To make the mind a clean slate so the body can remember how to fall.
The hospital gown clings to her shoulders, thin as tissue paper, and she can feel where the wind presses it against her spine, her thighs, outlining the geography of her flesh. They always give you this gown. She does not know why. Perhaps because it is what dying people wear, and falling is a kind of dying, or perhaps because the fabric tears away so easily, leaving you naked before you reach the ground. Naked and free. She has done this seventeen times before and each time the gown has abandoned her somewhere in the middle distance between heaven and earth.
She closes her eyes and feels the concrete beneath the soles of her feet, rough and cold and real. The edge is precise. One half centimeter forward and there is only air. She has measured this distance before with her toes, memorizing the exact point where solid becomes void, where decision becomes consequence. The building breathes beneath her. She can feel its subtle movements, the way it sways like a reed in water, responding to pressures invisible and immense.
The sky above is the color of a bruise. Purple and black and threaded with orange from the city's reflected light. No stars. There have not been stars over this city for twenty years or more. She thinks briefly of a memory she may have had of stars, but it dissolves before it can take shape. Memory is unreliable. Memory is the enemy of this moment. She has learned to kill her memories, to strangle them in their cribs before they can grow large enough to matter.
She opens her eyes.
The city waits below like an open mouth.
She takes one breath. Holds it. Feels her lungs fill with the cold air, feels them press against her ribs, expanding her chest until she thinks she might float away like a balloon. She thinks of nothing. She is thinking of nothing. This is a lie. She is thinking of the moment of impact, the way the ground will rise up to meet her like a collision with God, sudden and absolute and without mercy. She is thinking of the instant before, when her body will know—truly know, in the wordless language of flesh and bone—that it is about to end.
But that instant never comes. That is the secret. You fall forever in your mind, but the body has its own truth.
She steps forward.
The concrete disappears beneath her foot and there is a single moment of absolute silence, a gap in the world where sound used to live, and then she is falling and the wind takes her.
It begins as a roar. The air becomes solid, becomes a force that tears at her gown, that whips her hair back from her face, that fills her mouth and throat until she cannot tell if she is screaming or singing or both. The gown rips first at the shoulder seam, the thin fabric giving way like skin tearing, and she feels it peel down her arm, across her breast, exposing her to the night. The wind is a thousand hands touching her everywhere at once, running over her stomach, between her thighs, cupping her face with a pressure that is almost gentle, almost loving.
She spreads her arms wide.
The second shoulder seam goes and the gown flutters away above her, a white ghost ascending while she descends, and she is naked now, completely naked, and the wind has become her only clothing. It holds her, caresses her, explores every inch of her skin with an intimacy that is beyond human, beyond anything her girlfriend's hands have ever achieved. She arches her back and the air rushes over her nipples, down the curve of her belly, between her legs with a pressure that makes her gasp. This is the moment. This is what she pays for, what she comes back for again and again.
The fall is a kind of kissing.
Not the polite kiss, the closed-mouth greeting between acquaintances. Not even the hungry kiss of new lovers discovering each other's taste. No. This is the kiss that erases the boundary between bodies, the deep French kiss where tongues meet and tangle, where breath mingles until you cannot remember whose lungs the air came from, where you open your mouth so wide that your partner could crawl inside you if they wanted, if the laws of physics permitted such a thing. The wind is inside her mouth, down her throat, filling her lungs with each gasping breath. She is kissing the sky and the sky is kissing her back with a passion that borders on violence.
She tumbles. The world spins around her—sky, building, city, sky—a carousel of light and darkness turning so fast that it blurs into a single smear of sensation. She does not try to stabilize herself, does not spread her limbs into a skydive position. She lets herself cartwheel through space, head over heels, arms and legs trailing like ribbons. Each revolution brings a new perspective: the building's face rushing past in a streak of windows and concrete, the ground expanding below like a blooming flower, the sky wheeling overhead like a great dark carousel.
The wind enters her. Not metaphorically. She can feel it penetrating every opening—mouth, nose, ears—can feel it sliding between the lips of her vagina, probing at her anus with insistent pressure. She is being fucked by gravity itself, by the physics of descent, and she surrenders to it completely. Her clit throbs with each gust, each shift in air pressure. She is wet. She can feel it even in the screaming chaos of the fall, can feel moisture between her legs mixing with the sweat that the wind tears from her skin and carries upward in a fine mist.
Forty stories. Thirty-five. Thirty.
The building's face resolves into individual windows. She can see inside them now as she falls past—a man at a desk, his face lit blue by a computer screen; an empty hallway with fluorescent lights humming their monotonous song; a woman standing at a window looking out, looking perhaps at her, though she is moving too fast to be sure. These glimpses of life flash past like images in a slideshow, each one appearing and disappearing in less than a heartbeat.
Twenty-five stories.
Her hair whips across her face, stinging her cheeks, getting into her mouth. She tastes salt—her own sweat, or perhaps tears, though she is not crying, has not cried in so long that she has forgotten what it feels like. The wind has worked its way completely between her legs now, a constant pressure against her sex, and she grinds against it instinctively, her hips moving in small circles, chasing the sensation even as she plummets toward her death. Or not her death. The not-death that waits below. But she does not think of that. She cannot think of that without breaking the spell.
Twenty stories.
The kiss deepens. The wind's tongue is everywhere, licking the hollow of her throat, the undersides of her breasts, the sensitive skin behind her knees. She opens her mouth wider and it fills her completely, choking her, sustaining her, becoming the only thing she needs. She does not need food or water or love or safety. She needs only this, this terrible intimacy with the void, this coupling with emptiness that feels more real than any human touch ever has.
Fifteen stories.
The details of the ground emerge now from the general blur. She can see the geometry of streets, the shapes of cars, the rectangles of light that are doorways and windows. She can see the crowd that has gathered, though they are still too far away to be more than dark smudges against the pavement. They always gather. Someone always sees you go over the edge and calls it in, and people come running with their phones held high, ready to capture death, ready to witness the moment when a body stops being a person and becomes a thing.
Ten stories.
Her breath comes in short, sharp gasps now. The wind is too strong, too fast, and her lungs cannot keep up with the demands of her racing heart. Her skin burns from the friction of air moving at terminal velocity—one hundred and twenty miles per hour, fast enough to strip away the outer layer of epidermis, fast enough to leave her raw and red as if she has been flayed. She can feel it happening, feel her skin abrading away molecule by molecule, and it hurts, God it hurts, but the hurt is good, the hurt reminds her that she is alive, that she has a body at all.
Seven stories.
The kiss becomes a bite. The wind's teeth sink into her flesh, into her breasts and belly and thighs, marking her, claiming her. She will be bruised tomorrow, covered in contusions the shape of air currents, and she will trace them with her fingers and remember this moment, this perfect moment of surrender. Her girlfriend will see them and say nothing, will run her hands over the damaged skin with a gentleness that Simera can no longer feel, that registers as nothing more than pressure, as neutral as a breeze.
Five stories.
She can see faces in the crowd now. Mouths open in expressions she can no longer read. Fear? Excitement? Arousal? It does not matter. They are watching her die and they are watching her come, and they cannot tell the difference because there is no difference, not here, not in this moment. Her orgasm builds in the base of her spine, radiating outward like a shock wave, tightening every muscle in her body until she is rigid, until she is a spear aimed at the earth.
Three stories.
The ground rushes up with the inevitability of mathematics. Concrete and asphalt, hard and final and absolutely unforgiving. She can see the individual pebbles embedded in the pavement, can see the yellow paint of a parking space dividing line, can see the dark stain where someone spilled coffee or oil or blood. Every detail crystallizes with hyper-real clarity. Time does not slow—time is a human invention and has no power here—but her perception sharpens until she is seeing with a resolution beyond what her eyes should be capable of.
Two stories.
Her body convulses. The orgasm breaks over her like a wave, like the ground about to break her body, and she screams but the wind tears the sound away before it can escape her throat. Every nerve ending fires at once, sending signals of pleasure-pain-terror-ecstasy cascading through her nervous system faster than thought, faster than fear. She is coming and she is dying and she is more alive than she has ever been in the sad small rooms of her actual life.
One story.
The ground fills her vision, fills the world, becomes the only thing that exists. She can see her reflection in a puddle of water—a pale streak falling toward itself, two bodies racing to merge. She reaches out with her hands, though she knows it will not help, knows nothing can help now. Her fingers spread wide as if to catch herself, as if to embrace the pavement that will shatter every bone in her body.
The kiss reaches its climax. The wind enters her completely, possesses her, and she opens herself wider, wider, offering everything she has to this final moment, this instant of absolute truth when the lie of her life will finally end—
And—
Chapter Two: Waking Up, Initial Situation
She opened her eyes to a ceiling the color of old teeth. Water-stained and sagging slightly in the middle where the structural supports had weakened over decades of neglect. She stared at it and tried to remember what ceilings were for, what purpose they served beyond keeping the sky at bay. The texture resolved slowly, the cracks forming patterns that her brain attempted to interpret as meaning—faces, words, maps of territories that did not exist.
Her body was cold.
Not the wind-cold of the fall, but the clinging damp cold of sweat soaking through thin sheets, through the foam mattress that had worn through in the center until she slept in a shallow depression shaped by years of her body's weight. She lay very still and took inventory of her limbs. Arms: present. Legs: present. Fingers and toes: presumably attached, though she could not feel them yet. Her heart hammered against her ribs with an urgency that seemed inappropriate for someone lying motionless in bed.
"You were making sounds."
The voice came from her left. Simera did not turn her head immediately. Turning required decision, required the conscious act of moving muscles, and she was not ready for that level of commitment to being awake. She continued to study the ceiling, watching a small spider navigate the topography of paint chips and plaster.
"Like an animal," the voice continued. "Not human sounds. You scared me."
Liz. Of course it was Liz. Who else would be sitting in the broken wicker chair they had salvaged from the street three months ago, the one that creaked whenever you shifted your weight, the one that left imprints on your thighs like a waffle iron if you sat too long. Simera could hear the creaking now, a rhythmic complaint as Liz rocked slightly, and she knew without looking that her girlfriend would be hunched forward, elbows on knees, toying with something in her hands. A lighter. A deck of cards. The small black cube of the Memento machine.
Simera turned her head.
The room swam. Dimensions became negotiable. The walls breathed in and out like lungs, and she had to close her eyes and count to ten before the vertigo passed and the world agreed to solidify again. When she opened her eyes, Liz was watching her with an expression that might have been concern or might have been the neutral observation of a scientist watching a lab rat navigate a maze. In the gray light filtering through their single window—a window that looked out onto the brick wall of the adjacent building, so close you could reach out and touch it—her girlfriend's face was all angles and shadows.
"How long?" Simera's voice came out as a rasp, as if she had been screaming. Perhaps she had been. The Memento machine sometimes made you vocalize, made your body act out phantom movements while your consciousness was elsewhere, living someone else's moment.
"Forty minutes." Liz held up the machine. It was the size of a deck of cards, matte black, with a single small screen that glowed a soft blue. The interface was deliberately minimal—one button, one slider, one port for the neural connector that Simera could still feel attached to the base of her skull, the adhesive pulling at her skin. "It seemed longer. This one seemed really intense."
Simera sat up slowly. Her head felt swollen, pressurized, as if someone had pumped it full of fluid. The room tilted but corrected itself. She reached back and peeled away the connector, feeling the brief sting as it detached from the port—a surgical implant she had gotten two years ago when she first started using Mementos regularly, a tiny socket just behind her left ear where the plug fit perfectly. The skin around it was slightly inflamed. She needed to clean it more often.
"What was it?" Liz asked. She set the machine down on the floor, nudging it under the bed with her foot, as if putting it out of sight might make what Simera had just experienced less real. "What did you do this time?"
"Fell."
"Again?"
Simera nodded. The motion sent a spike of pain through her temples. She pressed her fingers against her forehead, applying pressure until the throb subsided to a manageable level. "Different building. Taller."
Liz made a sound that might have been a laugh or might have been its opposite. She stood and walked to the window, though there was nothing to see beyond the brick wall and the thin slice of sky visible above it. She wore an old t-shirt that had once been black but had faded to a shade of gray that matched the walls, and underwear that was more hole than fabric. Her legs were thin, the knees knobby and slightly knocked. Simera looked at her and tried to remember when she had last really looked at her girlfriend, when she had last paid attention to the specific details of her body, the particular architecture of her bones.
"You smell like fear," Liz said without turning around. "Sweat and adrenaline. Your whole body is trying to process a trauma that didn't actually happen to you. That's what the doctor said, remember? Each time you run a Memento, your body has to metabolize the experience like a poison. It takes days for your cortisol levels to return to normal."
"The doctor also said it wasn't dangerous."
"The doctor was paid to say that by Heri Corporation. His office had their logo on every piece of paper, every screen, every pen. He might as well have been wearing their uniform."
Simera swung her legs out of bed. Her feet found the cold floor, linoleum that was cracked and curling at the edges, exposing the concrete beneath. The apartment was a single room that tried to pretend it was multiple rooms through strategic placement of furniture. The bed in one corner. A kitchenette—a hot plate, a small refrigerator that hummed like a dying insect, a sink with a faucet that dripped at irregular intervals—in another. A bathroom so small that you had to sit on the toilet sideways, your knees pressed against the shower stall. Everything was the color of poverty, that particular shade of beige-gray-brown that came from years of grime layering over cheap paint.
"I need to shower," Simera said.
"We don't have hot water until tonight. Landlord said the boiler's broken."
"Cold then."
She stood, and for a moment the room spun again, harder this time, and she had to grab the edge of the mattress to keep from falling. Liz was there instantly, her hand on Simera's elbow, steadying her. The touch was gentle but firm, the grip of someone who had caught her before, who knew how to hold her without being told.
"I'm fine," Simera said.
"You're not fine. You're never fine after. It takes a toll, Sim. Whether you want to admit it or not."
Simera pulled away, more forcefully than necessary, and walked to the bathroom. The floor was cold enough that it hurt, the kind of cold that went beyond temperature and became almost textural, like walking on ice. She did not close the door—the door did not close properly anyway, the hinges had given up months ago—and she could feel Liz watching her as she turned on the shower and waited for the water to begin its stuttering flow.
The mirror above the sink was cracked, dividing her reflection into three distinct pieces that did not quite align. She looked at herself—at her selves—and tried to find something recognizable. Pale skin, almost translucent in the bad light. Hair the color of dishwater, hanging limp to her shoulders. Eyes that were perhaps blue or perhaps gray, she could never remember which. Thin lips. A face that was neither beautiful nor ugly, just a collection of features arranged in the standard configuration.
Bruises decorated her body like strange flowers blooming on pale soil. On her thighs where the wind had pressed hardest. Across her ribs where the trauma of impact had somehow transferred through the neural connection, manifesting as physical marks. The doctors said this was normal, that some users developed what they called "echo contusions," phantom injuries that appeared on the skin despite no actual tissue damage. They would fade in a few days, replaced by new ones from the next Memento.
The water was cold enough to make her gasp when she stepped under it. She stood there and let it pour over her head, her shoulders, streaming down her body in rivulets that pooled at her feet before draining away through the rust-stained grate. The cold shocked her system, reset something in her brain that had been knocked loose by the fall. She closed her eyes and tried not to think about the pavement rushing up to meet her, about the moment of impact that never came, that was always deferred, always delayed until the Memento ended and dumped her back into this room, this body, this life.
"I got another message today," Liz called from the main room. Her voice was carefully casual, the tone of someone introducing a topic they knew would lead to an argument. "From the mark downtown. The one who thinks he's investing in crypto futures. He's ready to commit another five thousand."
Simera did not respond. She ran her hands through her hair, scrubbing her scalp with her fingernails, trying to wash away the feeling of falling, the ghost sensation of wind moving through her.
"That's two weeks of rent," Liz continued. "Maybe three if we're careful. Plus food. Plus maybe we could get the sink fixed."
"You said that one was too risky. You said he seemed like the type to go to the police."
"I've been working him for three months. Building trust. He thinks I'm a financial consultant. He thinks I have inside information. He's ready to buy in, Sim. He wants to buy in."
Simera turned off the water. She stood dripping in the tiny shower stall, watching the water spiral down the drain. The pattern was hypnotic—the way the liquid curved as it descended, following the physics of rotation and gravity, disappearing into darkness. She thought about water falling forever, never reaching the bottom, and she thought about herself falling, and she thought about the difference between the two.
She stepped out and grabbed the towel hanging on the hook behind the door. It was rough and thin, more like sandpaper than cloth, and it scratched her skin as she dried herself. Liz appeared in the doorway, leaning against the frame with her arms crossed.
"I'm not judging you," Liz said. "For the Mementos. I know you need them."
"Do you?"
"Need them? No. Understand why you need them? Maybe. I think you're looking for something that doesn't exist. I think you're trying to feel something that life doesn't actually provide. But that's fine. That's your choice. I'm just saying we have bills to pay, and five thousand would help."
Simera wrapped the towel around herself and pushed past her girlfriend into the main room. The air was warmer here, but not by much. Their apartment retained cold the way some buildings retain heat, as if the walls were made of ice instead of concrete. She found underwear and a shirt in the pile of clean laundry that lived permanently on the chair in the corner—the chair where they put clean clothes with the intention of folding them, clothes that would remain in that chair until they were worn again and rejoined the cycle.
"He's not going to go to the police," Liz said. "Because that would mean admitting he was stupid enough to fall for it. Men like him don't admit stupidity. They just take the loss and pretend it never happened."
"You sound very confident."
"I've been doing this for four years. I know how it works."
Simera pulled on jeans, the fabric stiff and cold against her damp skin. She could feel Liz watching her, waiting for a response, for permission or objection. This was the dance they did—Liz proposing the scams, outlining the marks, explaining the plays, while Simera listened and said little and eventually nodded or shook her head. They both knew she would nod. They always needed the money. The money was always running out.
"Five thousand," Simera said. "You're sure?"
"He already transferred two as a good-faith payment. I have it in the holding account. Once he commits the rest, I'll walk away. Close the identity. He'll never find me."
Simera sat on the edge of the bed and stared at the Memento machine where Liz had shoved it under the frame. She could see the edge of it protruding, the corner of black plastic catching the light. Such a small thing to contain such enormes experiences. Such a tiny device to hold entire lives, entire deaths, entire moments of perfect sensation torn from their context and packaged for consumption.
"Do you think it's real?" Simera asked. "When you're in it? Do you think the person who recorded it really felt what you feel?"
Liz came and sat beside her. She did not touch her, did not put an arm around her shoulders or take her hand. They had learned that Simera needed space after a Memento, needed time to settle back into her own skin before she could tolerate touch. "Does it matter?"
"I don't know. Maybe. I think about the person who jumped off that building, who created that memory. I think about whether they survived, or whether that was their last moment. Whether they knew they were creating something to sell, or whether they thought they were just dying."
"The ones who know they're creating always survive. They have safety systems. Airbags. Nets. The real deaths, those are illegal to sell. Black market only."
"But you can buy them."
Liz was quiet for a moment. Then: "Yes. You can buy them. If you know where to look and have enough money. But those cost more than we'll ever have. Those cost more than cars, more than apartments. People spend their entire life savings to die for real in someone else's body."
"Do you think that's what I want?"
"I think you want something. I don't know if even you know what it is."
Simera lay back on the bed, staring again at the ceiling, at the spider that had completed its journey across the water stain and was now building a web in the corner where the walls met. She watched it work, admiring the patience of it, the methodical construction of something beautiful and deadly.
"I need to work tonight," she said. "The restaurant called. They need someone for the dinner shift."
"How much?"
"Eighty for six hours. Plus tips if anyone leaves them, which they won't."
Liz laughed, short and bitter. "Eighty. Jesus. You could buy half a Memento with that. A cheap one. Maybe a nice dinner at a mediocre restaurant. Maybe three rides on the metro."
"It's what they pay."
"It's slavery with extra steps."
"Then do something about it. Start a revolution. Overthrow the system."
"Why bother?" Liz stood and walked back to the window, resuming her position staring at the brick wall. "The universe is absurd. Work is absurd. Revolutions are absurd. We're all just waiting for entropy to catch up with us, pretending that our actions matter when really we're just making noise in the void until we stop making noise and join the void ourselves."
"That's cheerful."
"It's honest. And honesty is all we have. Camus said that life is absurd and the only philosophical question is whether to commit suicide or keep going. He said we should keep going. Not because there's meaning, but because there isn't. Because the absurdity is the point. We're supposed to embrace it."
Simera closed her eyes. The conversation was familiar, worn smooth by repetition. Liz and her philosophy, her constant references to thinkers and theories, her insistence that life had no meaning except the meaning we invented through our refusal to surrender. Simera did not disagree, exactly. She just did not care. Meaning or no meaning, absurd or not, she still had to work the dinner shift at a restaurant where the food was mediocre and the customers were worse. She still had to smile at them and take their orders and bring them plates of protein and carbohydrates arranged in geometries that pretended to be cuisine.
"I should sleep," Simera said. "A few hours before work."
"I'll be quiet."
But Liz would not be quiet. She never was. She would pace the room, thinking, muttering to herself, working out the details of her scams in whispered monologues. She would shuffle her deck of cards, practicing sleight of hand for cons she would never pull because card tricks were theatrical and obvious and modern scams happened online, through screens, through carefully constructed identities that existed only as text and profile pictures. She would make tea that she would forget to drink, leaving cups on every surface until the apartment smelled like steeped leaves and mildew.
But Simera would sleep anyway. She had learned to sleep through anything. She closed her eyes and felt herself beginning to drift, her body sinking into the depression in the mattress, her mind detaching from the specifics of where she was and who she was and what she had just experienced. The fall played again behind her eyelids—the moment of stepping off, the wind's first kiss, the ground rising to meet her—but gentler now, fading like a photograph left too long in sunlight.
The last thing she heard before sleep took her was Liz's voice, soft and distant: "I love you. Even though you're disappearing. Even though you're choosing to disappear."
Simera did not answer. She was already gone.
Chapter Three: We See Simera and Her Girlfriend Struggling to Make Money
The restaurant was called Nouveau Terre, which meant New Earth but was pronounced incorrectly by everyone including the staff. It occupied the ground floor of a building that had once been a warehouse and now housed what the developers called "mixed-use retail spaces," which meant restaurants and boutiques that all looked identical and sold slightly different versions of the same gentrified experience. The facade was exposed brick and large windows, the interior was reclaimed wood and Edison bulbs, and the menu featured small plates of deconstructed cuisine that cost more than Simera made in an hour.
She arrived at four in the afternoon, two hours before service, and found Mikel already in the kitchen, chopping vegetables with the intense concentration of someone who had learned to cook in prison or war. He did not look up when she entered.
"Mise en place," he said. "Start with the onions. Then the garlic. Then the herbs."
Simera tied on her apron—black, like all the aprons, with the restaurant's logo embroidered in white thread across the chest—and began her prep work. The kitchen was small and hot, the ventilation system struggling against the heat from the stoves, and within minutes she was sweating. She worked mechanically, her hands performing the familiar motions while her mind wandered elsewhere.
The knife moved through the onion. The layers separated. The smell of sulfur made her eyes water, and she blinked away tears that were chemical rather than emotional, physiological rather than psychological. She thought about the fall. She always thought about the fall. It had been six hours since she had woken from the Memento, and already the details were fading, the edges of the experience blurring like a painting left out in rain. She tried to hold onto it—the feeling of wind against her skin, the moment of surrender when she stepped off the ledge—but it slipped through her memory like water through a sieve.
This was the problem with Mementos. They burned bright and brief, and then they were gone, leaving only the ghost of sensation behind. You could not replay them—each Memento could only be experienced once before it was consumed, deleted from the chip, erased like a memory that had been lived and lost. Some people kept libraries of Mementos, collecting them like others collected stamps or coins, never using them, just possessing them. But Simera burned through hers as soon as she bought them. She needed the experience, not the potential for experience.
"You're crying," Mikel said. He had moved on to trimming chicken, breaking down whole birds with precise cuts that separated flesh from bone with surgical efficiency. "The onions get everyone the first hour. You'll adjust."
She nodded and continued chopping. The tears were useful. They allowed her to feel something that resembled emotion without having to access actual emotion. She could cry over onions but not over her life. She could cry over vegetables but not over the fact that she was twenty-seven years old and worked twelve-hour shifts for eighty units and went home to an apartment that was one step above a prison cell.
The other servers began arriving as five o'clock approached. Marcus, who was beautiful in a way that made customers leave larger tips and who knew this and exploited it without shame. Celine, who was studying sociology and treated the restaurant like an anthropological field site, taking mental notes on class and consumption. Joel, who was sixty-three and had been working service jobs his entire life and had developed a kind of zen acceptance of the indignities involved.
They gathered in the small room that served as both office and break room, and Sasha—the manager, who was twenty-four and had been promoted because her parents were investors—went through the specials and the reservations and the VIP tables that needed particular attention.
"We have a party of eight at seven," Sasha said, reading from her tablet. "Corporate dinner. They've pre-ordered the tasting menu. Don't rush them, but keep the courses moving. They're on an expense account, so suggest wine pairings. Marcus, you'll take that table."
Marcus smiled. "Of course."
"Simera, you'll have the four-top by the window at six-thirty. Anniversary couple. He called ahead to request a specific table and asked about our dessert options, so he's probably proposing. Be romantic but not intrusive."
Simera nodded. She had done this before, had witnessed dozens of proposals, had brought champagne and desserts arranged in the shape of hearts while men got down on one knee and women pretended to be surprised. It was theater, all of it, a performance of emotions that everyone agreed to participate in even though everyone knew it was scripted.
Service began at six. The first customers trickled in—early diners who wanted to eat and leave before the restaurant filled, who treated dinner like an obligation to be completed efficiently. Simera took their orders, brought their water, smiled when expected. Her face knew how to smile without consulting her brain, had learned the muscle movements required to appear pleasant and attentive and grateful for their business.
The anniversary couple arrived exactly on time. He was nervous, touching his jacket pocket every few minutes to verify the ring was still there. She was dressed carefully, her makeup applied with the precision of someone who knew photographs would be taken. They ordered wine, white for her and red for him, and Simera brought the bottles and poured small tastes for their approval.
"It's perfect," the woman said. She was young, perhaps Simera's age, with blonde hair that had been curled and sprayed into submission. "Everything's perfect."
Simera wondered what perfection felt like. If it had a taste or a texture. If it could be measured or only recognized by its absence. She brought them appetizers—small plates of food that were more art than sustenance, proteins arranged in towers, sauces drizzled in careful spirals. They ate slowly, talking in the low voices of people who were aware they were being watched, that everyone in the restaurant knew what was about to happen.
Between courses, Simera retreated to the kitchen and stood near the dish station, letting the heat from the industrial dishwasher warm her hands. Marcus came in carrying a tray of empty plates, shaking his head.
"Table eight wants to send back the duck. Says it's overcooked."
"It's not," Mikel said without looking up from the pan where he was searing scallops. "It's perfect. They just don't know what duck is supposed to look like."
"I'll tell them the chef respectfully disagrees with their assessment and offer them something else."
"Tell them to order chicken next time if they want it cooked to death."
Marcus laughed and went back out. This was the rhythm of service—the constant movement between dining room and kitchen, between the performance of hospitality and the reality of labor. Simera had been doing this for three years, working restaurants and cafes and bars, always the same job with different names, different menus, different managers who all treated staff with the same casual indifference.
The anniversary couple ordered dessert at eight-thirty. Simera brought them the chocolate mousse arranged in a sugar cage, and as she set it down the man stood and got on one knee and pulled out the ring and said words that Simera did not listen to because she had heard them before, would hear them again, words that were always the same even when they were different. The woman said yes and cried and people at nearby tables applauded and someone took photographs and Simera brought champagne on the house because that was what Sasha had instructed her to do.
"Congratulations," Simera said, and her voice was warm and sincere and completely empty. "I'm so happy for you both."
The woman looked at her with shining eyes. "Thank you. Thank you so much. This is the happiest day of my life."
Simera wondered what that felt like. If happiness had degrees, had a scale from baseline contentment to peak joy. If the happiest day of your life meant all other days were shadows, inferior copies, disappointments by definition. She smiled and nodded and refilled their champagne and left them to their happiness.
The shift ended at eleven. She had made eighty units plus thirty-seven in tips, which meant one hundred seventeen total, which meant she could buy a cheap Memento if she wanted, something brief and intense, maybe someone else's orgasm or someone else's victory or someone else's moment of transcendent beauty. Or she could save it. Add it to the small amount they kept hidden in the apartment, cash that Liz said was important to have because when the system collapsed you could not eat digital currency, could not barter with numbers in an account.
She changed out of her apron and walked home through streets that were mostly empty except for the people who lived in the streets, the ones who slept in doorways and under overpasses, who had given up on apartments and jobs and the pretense of participating in the economy. She walked past them without looking, following the protocol that everyone followed—acknowledge no one, make eye contact with no one, proceed from point A to point B as if the human suffering along the route did not exist.
The apartment was dark when she arrived. Liz was asleep, or pretending to be, curled on her side of the bed with her back to the door. Simera undressed quietly and lay down beside her, not touching, leaving the gap of space between them that had grown over months from inches to feet. She could hear Liz breathing, the slow rhythm of sleep, and she tried to match her own breath to it, tried to synchronize their bodies in this small way since they could no longer synchronize in larger ones.
But sleep would not come. She lay in the darkness and thought about the fall, about the wind and the ground and the moment that never arrived. She thought about the anniversary couple and their happiness, about whether happiness was real or just another performance, another script that people agreed to follow because the alternative was to admit that nothing meant anything. She thought about Liz and her philosophy, her insistence that life was absurd and that the proper response to absurdity was to keep living anyway, to embrace the meaninglessness without surrendering to it.
Simera did not know if she agreed. She thought maybe the proper response to meaninglessness was to find meaning elsewhere, even if that meaning was artificial, even if it was borrowed from someone else's life, someone else's moment. The Mementos gave her something that her own life did not. They gave her intensity, sensation, the feeling of being alive in a way that working at Nouveau Terre or sleeping in this room or existing in this body did not provide.
She got out of bed carefully, trying not to wake Liz, and went to the window. The brick wall was there, solid and close, blocking any view that might have existed. She pressed her hand against the glass and felt how cold it was, how the outside temperature transmitted through the thin barrier. She thought about the people she had seen sleeping on the streets, wondered how they survived the cold, wondered if they used Mementos too, if they spent their begged money on memories of warmth, of safety, of lives that were not their own.
Behind her, Liz stirred. "Can't sleep?"
"No."
"Thinking about it? The fall?"
"Yes."
Liz was quiet for a moment. Then: "What is it about falling? You always come back to falling."
Simera did not answer immediately. She tried to find words for something that existed before words, that was more primitive than language. "It's the only time I feel certain," she finally said. "When you're falling, you know what's going to happen. You know exactly what's going to happen. There's no ambiguity, no choice, no possibility of being wrong. You're falling and the ground is coming and that's all there is."
"But you never hit the ground."
"No."
"So you never get the certainty. You get everything up to the moment of certainty, and then it ends. It cuts away. You're left with anticipation forever, with the approach but never the arrival."
"Maybe that's better. Maybe the moment of impact would ruin it."
Liz got out of bed and came to stand beside her at the window. She was wearing one of Simera's old shirts, the fabric hanging loose on her smaller frame. In the darkness they were just shapes, outlines, two forms that occupied the same space without quite touching.
"Do you know what I did today?" Liz asked. "While you were at work?"
"The mark downtown. The crypto scam."
"Yes. That. But also I went to the library. Did you know they still have libraries? Physical buildings where you can read physical books? It's like visiting a museum. Everything's old and quiet and smells like decay."
"What did you read?"
"Camus. Again. Always Camus. I keep coming back to The Myth of Sisyphus, to his argument about suicide and meaning. He says we have to imagine Sisyphus happy, pushing his boulder up the hill knowing it will roll back down, doing it forever because that's his punishment. But the happiness comes from accepting it, from understanding that the task is meaningless and doing it anyway."
"That sounds terrible."
"It is terrible. That's the point. Life is terrible and meaningless and we do it anyway. That's the only victory available to us—the victory of continuing despite everything."
Simera leaned her forehead against the glass. It was so cold that it hurt, a sharp ache that spread across her skin. "What if continuing isn't enough? What if I need more than just the act of continuing?"
"Then you buy Mementos. You borrow other people's lives. You fall off buildings without dying." Liz's voice was gentle, without judgment, but also without approval. "But it's not sustainable, Sim. You know that. The more you use them, the more you need them. And eventually your own life becomes so pale in comparison that you can't stand to be in it."
"My own life is already pale."
"Then change it."
"How?"
"I don't know. That's the absurd part. There's no instruction manual, no correct answer. You just have to choose something and commit to it. Even if it's wrong. Even if it fails."
They stood together at the window, looking at the brick wall that was all they could see of the world beyond their room. Somewhere in the city, people were living lives of consequence and meaning, or at least lives that felt that way. Somewhere, people were falling from buildings and recording the experience, packaging their trauma for sale, commodifying death so that others could taste it without the commitment. Somewhere, Heri Corporation was processing thousands of Mementos, cataloging memories, setting prices based on intensity and rarity and demand.
"I saw something today," Liz said. "An advertisement on the metro. Heri is buying. They're looking for creators. They're offering bounties for specific experiences—extreme sports, dangerous jobs, intimate moments. The more intense the memory, the more they pay."
Simera turned to look at her girlfriend. In the darkness she could barely see Liz's face, just the outline of her features, the shape of her in space. "How much?"
"For falls? Five thousand units for anything over forty stories. Ten thousand if it's without safety equipment. Fifty thousand if it's..." She paused. "If it's real. If you actually die."
"Fifty thousand."
"That's what the ad said. I took a photo of it. I can show you."
"That's more money than we'd make in two years. Working."
"Yes."
"That's enough to move out of this place. Get somewhere with windows that show more than a wall. Somewhere with heat that works."
"Yes."
They were both quiet. The numbers hung in the air between them, enormous and impossible and somehow within reach. Fifty thousand units. The price of a death. The value that Heri Corporation placed on someone's final moment, their last sensation, their ultimate experience. Simera thought about the fall she had experienced that morning, the beauty of it, the perfection of surrender. She thought about doing it for real, without the safety net of the Memento playback, without the guarantee of waking up in her bed with Liz beside her.
"I'm not suggesting you do it," Liz said quickly. "I'm not suggesting anything. I just thought you should know. Since you're already using them, since you already love falling."
"But you are suggesting it. By telling me. By letting me know the price."
"Maybe. I don't know. I'm thinking out loud. Trying to work out the ethics of it. Is it more ethical to starve slowly in this room, or to sell your death for enough money to actually live? Is survival at any cost absurd, or is it the only thing that matters?"
Simera moved away from the window and sat on the edge of the bed. Her body ached from the six-hour shift, from standing and walking and carrying trays, from smiling muscles she did not use otherwise. She thought about the anniversary couple, about their happiness, about whether they had any idea how lucky they were to be able to afford a meal that cost more than she made in a week. She thought about the man getting down on one knee, about the woman crying with joy, about whether either of them had ever considered selling their death to escape poverty.
"There are other ways to make money," Simera said. "Creating Mementos that aren't death. Sex, maybe. Or drugs. Or violence that stops short of murder."
"Those pay less. A lot less. A sexual encounter might get you five hundred units. A drug experience maybe a thousand. You'd need to create dozens of them to make any real money. And each one takes a toll. Each one blurs the line a little more between what's real and what's memory."
"So the choice is poverty or death."
"Or poverty and death. Eventually. We're all dying, just at different speeds."
Liz came and sat beside her. This time she did touch her, putting her hand on Simera's thigh, the pressure light but present. "I don't want you to die. Even for fifty thousand units. Even if it would save us. I'd rather be poor with you alive than comfortable with you dead."
"But you told me anyway."
"Because I'm honest. Because I don't believe in protecting people from information. Because you have a right to know what your options are, even if I hate all of them."
Simera covered Liz's hand with her own. The touch still registered as touch, still activated the nerve endings in her palm, but the emotional component was muted, distant, as if she were feeling it through a layer of insulation. This was what Liz meant when she said Simera was disappearing. Not physically—her body was still here, still occupied this space—but emotionally, psychologically, the part of her that connected sensation to meaning was dissolving, eroded by too many borrowed experiences, too many moments that belonged to someone else.
"I'm not going to kill myself," Simera said. "Not yet. But I am going to create Mementos. Not death ones. Not yet. But other things. Falls with safety equipment. Risks that are calculated."
"Why?"
"Because working at Nouveau Terre for eighty units a shift is its own kind of death. Slower. More humiliating. At least creating Mementos, I'd be doing something. Living something. Even if it's dangerous."
"Creating is different from consuming. When you consume a Memento, you're a passenger. When you create one, you're the one in danger. Your body. Your risk."
"I know."
"And once you start, it's hard to stop. They'll want more. Heri always wants more. The market demands escalation. What's extreme today becomes boring tomorrow. You'll have to keep pushing, keep taking larger risks, until eventually the risk is too large and you don't come back."
"Maybe. Or maybe I'll make enough money that I can stop. That we can stop. Both of us. You can stop scamming people, I can stop falling off buildings, and we can just exist for a while. Figure out what life is supposed to be when you're not constantly scrambling to survive it."
Liz laughed, soft and sad. "That's the dream, isn't it? To have enough. To reach the point where you can stop running and just be. But I don't think that point exists. I think no matter how much money you have, you're still running. You're just running on a nicer treadmill."
"Then what's the point of any of it?"
"There isn't one. That's what I keep trying to tell you. There's no point. No meaning. No ultimate purpose. We're here by accident, in a universe that doesn't care if we live or die, and the only thing we can do is choose how we respond to that fact. Camus says we should respond with defiance. Keep living, keep pushing the boulder, keep doing the meaningless thing because fuck the universe for making it meaningless."
"And what do you say?"
Liz was quiet for a long time. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper. "I say I'm tired. I say defiance is exhausting. I say maybe Sisyphus isn't happy, maybe he's just numb, and maybe numbness is the best we can hope for. I say I love you but I'm watching you disappear and I don't know how to stop it and maybe I'm disappearing too, just in a different direction."
Simera pulled her girlfriend close, wrapping her arms around the smaller body, feeling the warmth of her through the thin shirt. They sat like that for a long time, two people holding each other in the darkness, trying to anchor themselves to something solid while the world dissolved around them into abstraction and uncertainty and the cold mathematics of survival.
Outside, the city continued its endless cycle—people working, people buying, people selling pieces of themselves to get by. Somewhere in that vast machine, Heri Corporation was processing memories, cataloging experiences, determining the market value of human sensation. Somewhere, someone was falling from a building, dying or pretending to die, creating content for strangers to consume. Somewhere, someone was putting on a neural connector and pressing play, borrowing someone else's life because their own had become unbearable.
And in this room, in this bed, two people who loved each other tried to remember what that meant, what it felt like, what it was supposed to accomplish in a world where love was not enough to pay rent or buy food or escape the gravity that pulled everyone downward toward their own particular ground.
"I'll go tomorrow," Simera said. "To Heri. I'll see what they're buying. What they'd pay for."
"Okay."
"You don't have to agree."
"I don't. But you're going to do it anyway. So okay."
"Will you come with me?"
"To watch you sell yourself? No. I don't think I can do that. But I'll be here when you get back. I'll always be here when you get back. Until the time you don't come back, and then I'll still be here, just alone."
They lay down together, still holding each other, and Simera closed her eyes and tried to sleep. But behind her eyelids she saw the ground rushing up, saw the pavement expanding to fill her vision, saw the moment of impact approaching in excruciating slow motion. She saw it and she wanted it and she was terrified of it, and she could not tell anymore which of those feelings was hers and which belonged to someone else, which were real memories and which were borrowed ones, which were her life and which were the life she had bought to replace it.
The spider in the corner had finished its web. She could not see it in the darkness, but she knew it was there, waiting patiently for something to fall into its trap, to become stuck in the sticky threads, to struggle until it tired and accepted its fate. The spider would wait as long as necessary. The spider had nothing but time. The spider did not need Mementos to feel alive. It simply was alive, in the way that simple creatures were, without consciousness or doubt or the burden of choosing meaning from meaninglessness.
Simera envied the spider. She envied everyone and everything that did not have to think about what they were doing, that could simply do and be and exist without the constant internal monologue questioning every sensation, every choice, every moment. She envied the anniversary couple their happiness, even if it was performance. She envied Liz her philosophy, her framework for understanding the world, her ability to name the absurdity without being destroyed by it.
But most of all she envied the person who had jumped from that building, who had created the Memento she had consumed that morning. She envied them their courage or their desperation or their certainty, whatever it was that had allowed them to step off the edge and commit to the fall. She envied them the purity of that moment, the clarity of it, the way it must have simplified everything down to a single binary—falling or not falling, alive or not alive, here or not here.
Tomorrow she would go to Heri. Tomorrow she would learn what her experiences were worth, what price the market placed on her body's capacity for sensation. Tomorrow she would take the first step toward becoming a creator rather than just a consumer, toward producing rather than just taking, toward risking rather than just witnessing risk through the safe buffer of someone else's memory.
But tonight she was still here, in this room, in this bed, in this body that was hers even though she increasingly did not want it. Tonight she was still Simera, whoever that was, whatever that meant. Tonight she could still feel Liz breathing beside her, could still recognize the familiar contours of her girlfriend's body, could still remember that she loved her even if the feeling had become abstract, theoretical, a fact she knew without being able to access its emotional content.
Tomorrow she might start to disappear for real. But tonight she was still here.
The spider waited in its web. The city hummed beyond the brick wall. The cold pressed against the window like a living thing trying to get in. And Simera lay in the darkness, eyes open, watching the ceiling, waiting for sleep or morning or some third thing she could not name, while her mind replayed the fall again and again, that perfect moment of surrender, that beautiful terrible kiss between body and void, that instant when everything became simple and clear and absolutely true.
She fell. She was always falling. Would always be falling. The ground was always approaching but never arriving, the impact always deferred, the moment of certainty always just out of reach.
This was her life now. This was what she had chosen, or what had chosen her, or what she had allowed to happen through the gradual accumulation of small surrenders that added up to a complete dissolution of self.
She fell.
And somewhere in the falling, she slept.
