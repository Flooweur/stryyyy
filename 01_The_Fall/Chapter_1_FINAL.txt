THE DISSOLUTION OF SIMERA

CHAPTER ONE: THE FALL


The wind does not howl at this height. It whispers.

She stands. She has always been standing. She will always be standing here, barefoot on the edge of the world—concrete lip forty stories above the pavement, the building's roof beneath her feet rough and cold and utterly indifferent to whether she stands or steps or simply ceases to be. 

The wind moves through the scaffolding of her ribs like a lover's fingers trailing downward, patient and deliberate, touching her in ways that demand nothing and promise everything. It speaks in a language older than words, older than thought. It tells her things about herself that she has always known but never admitted. That she is small. That she is temporary. That she is made of meat and water and electricity and nothing more. That she will end. That ending might be relief.

She stands. She has been standing for some time now. Minutes, perhaps. Or hours. Time moves strangely up here where the air is thin and the city below spreads itself like a catalog of human wanting. Her toes curl over the edge, gripping concrete that offers no grip, seeking purchase where there is none to be had. One centimeter forward and there is building. One centimeter beyond that and there is only air, only void, only the long fall toward certainty.

She breathes. In and out. In and out. The rhythm is automatic, stupid, the body's insistence on continuing even when continuation has lost its purpose. Each breath is a betrayal of her intention. Each heartbeat a small act of cowardice. But she forgives her body these failures. The body does not understand what the mind understands. The body thinks it wants to live.

But the body is wrong. Or the mind is wrong. One of them is lying. She has stopped being able to tell which.

The lights pulse and shimmer. Each window is a small fire of need. Each street a vein carrying the blood of commerce and desire through the body of the metropolis. From this height the city reveals itself as organism, as beast, as vast and terrible machine that consumes and excretes and continues consuming without pause or mercy or the faintest awareness of the woman standing on the edge of a building, preparing to fall. She can see them down there, the people. Thousands of them. Millions. They move like beetles through grooves worn smooth by repetition, like blood cells through veins, like data through circuits, following paths that were decided for them before they were born, before their parents were born, before anyone thought to ask whether the paths led anywhere worth arriving. They are trapped down there in their lives, in their bodies, in the endless grind of survival. They do not know what she knows. They have not learned what she has learned: that the only freedom is falling.

The poverty is visible from here in ways it is not visible from within. The dark zones where the lights are sparse and cheap. The sectors where buildings lean against each other like drunks seeking mutual support, their foundations crumbling, their walls graffitied with the desperate poetry of those who have nothing left but rage and spray paint. The districts where smoke rises from fires in barrels, where people burn trash to keep warm because heat is a commodity and some people cannot afford commodities, cannot afford the basic physics of not freezing. The city is a study in contrasts—the lit towers of commerce and power rising from a foundation of darkness and deprivation, monuments to wealth constructed from the compressed suffering of millions, cathedrals to capital built with the bones of the poor, the whole thing balanced precariously on the backs of those who will never see the views from the top floors, who will live and die in the shadows cast by buildings like this one, their lives as invisible as their labor, their deaths as unremarked as their births, their suffering converted into profit with the efficiency of a machine that knows no mercy because it knows nothing at all.

She thinks of nothing. This is the trick. This is what she has learned over the course of seventeen previous falls. To make the mind a clean slate so the body can remember how to do what bodies do when given permission to stop fighting, to stop clutching at life like a rope that is only pulling them deeper into water. She thinks of nothing. Her mind is empty. This is a lie, of course. The mind is never empty. Thoughts arrive unbidden like birds landing on power lines—they perch, they observe, they fly away. She is thinking about the ground. She is always thinking about the ground. About the pavement waiting below with the patience of stone, with the certainty of mathematics. The ground does not judge. The ground does not lie. The ground simply waits, and when you arrive it receives you with absolute honesty. She is thinking about impact. About the instant when velocity becomes zero and flesh meets concrete and everything stops.

But that instant never comes. That is the secret. You fall forever in your mind, but the body has its own truth, its own knowing that exists beyond thought, beyond memory, beyond the unreliable narratives we construct to explain what it means to be alive.

The hospital gown clings to her shoulders, thin as tissue paper, white as surrender. She can feel where the wind presses it against her spine, her thighs, outlining the geography of her flesh with a touch that is almost intimate, almost knowing. They always give you this gown. She does not know who they are—whether it is the building itself, some bureaucratic function of the structure, or whether it is something deeper, some universal they that determines the costume for dying. Perhaps because it is what dying people wear and falling is a kind of dying. Or perhaps because the fabric tears away so easily, leaving you naked before you reach the ground. Naked and free. She has done this seventeen times before and each time the gown has abandoned her somewhere in the middle distance between heaven and earth, fluttering upward like a ghost ascending while her body descends.

This will be the eighteenth time.

She closes her eyes and feels the concrete beneath the soles of her feet. Rough. Cold. Real in a way that nothing else has been real for longer than she can remember. The edge is precise. One half centimeter forward and there is only air. She has measured this distance before with her toes, memorizing the exact point where solid becomes void, where decision becomes consequence, where the illusion of control ends and physics begins. 

The building breathes beneath her. She can feel its subtle movements, the way it sways like a reed in water, responding to pressures invisible and immense—wind, weight, the slow patient pull of gravity working to reduce all standing things to rubble. Everything falls eventually. Buildings. Bodies. Civilizations. The only variable is speed. She has simply chosen to accelerate what was always inevitable.

The sky above is the color of a bruise. Purple and black and threaded with orange from the city's reflected light, the pollution that hangs in the air like a veil between the people and whatever stars might exist beyond it. No stars. There have not been stars over this city for twenty years or more. 

She thinks briefly of a memory she may have had of stars, of standing in a field somewhere in a place that is not the city, looking up at lights that were not human-made, that were older than humanity, older than earth itself. But the memory dissolves before it can take shape. Was it even her memory? Or was it borrowed, purchased, someone else's childhood imported into her skull? Memory is unreliable. Memory is the enemy of this moment. She has learned to kill her memories, to strangle them in their cribs before they can grow large enough to matter, before they can convince her that there is something worth remembering, something worth returning to.

She opens her eyes.

The city waits below like an open mouth.

She takes one breath. Holds it. Feels her lungs fill with the cold air, feels them press against her ribs, expanding her chest until she thinks she might float away like a balloon, might rise instead of fall, might escape gravity through simple inflation. She thinks of nothing. She is thinking of nothing. This is a lie. She is thinking of the moment of impact, the way the ground will rise up to meet her like a collision with God, sudden and absolute and without mercy. She is thinking of the instant before, when her body will know—truly know, in the wordless language of flesh and bone—that it is about to end.

Her girlfriend's hands cannot provide what the fall provides. She has tried. Liz has tried. They have tried together, bodies moving against each other in the dark, searching for some sensation intense enough to matter, some touch profound enough to register as more than pressure, more than temperature, more than the clinical fact of skin against skin. But flesh has limits. Human hands can only press so hard, can only explore so deeply. The fall is different. The fall opens her completely. The fall penetrates her in ways that no person can, no drug, no experience that stays within the boundaries of what is supposed to be possible for a body to endure and survive.

She exhales.

She steps forward.

The concrete disappears beneath her foot and there is a single moment of absolute silence, a gap in the world where sound used to live, and then she is falling and the wind takes her.

It begins as a roar.

The air becomes solid, becomes a force, becomes everything. It tears at her gown, whips her hair back from her face, fills her mouth and throat until she cannot tell if she is screaming or singing or silent, if she is falling or flying, if she is dying or finally, finally being born. The gown rips first at the shoulder seam, the thin fabric giving way like skin tearing, and she feels it peel down her arm, across her breast, exposing her to the night. Cold. The air is so cold that it burns. The wind is a thousand hands touching her everywhere at once, running over her stomach, between her thighs, cupping her face with a pressure that is almost gentle, almost loving, but underneath the gentleness is violence, is force, is the indifferent brutality of physics applied to flesh.

She spreads her arms wide.

The second shoulder seam goes and the gown flutters away above her, a white ghost ascending while she descends, and she is naked now, completely naked, and the wind has become her only clothing. It holds her. It caresses her. It explores every inch of her skin with an intimacy that is beyond human, beyond anything her girlfriend's hands have ever achieved in their careful explorations, their tentative mappings of her body's geography. She arches her back and the air rushes over her nipples—hard, aching, alive—down the curve of her belly, between her legs with a pressure that makes her gasp, makes her moan, makes her body convulse with sensation so intense it borders on pain, crosses into pain, becomes pain and pleasure fused into something that has no name in any language she knows. This is the moment. This is what she has paid for. What she will pay for again. What she will keep paying for as long as there is money and as long as there are buildings tall enough to fall from. This is what she comes back for again and again, what draws her out of the gray rooms of her life and up to the tops of buildings, to edges, to thresholds where the decision is binary and simple—step or don't step, fall or don't fall, live or die.

The fall is a kind of kissing.

Not the polite kiss, the closed-mouth greeting between acquaintances. Not even the hungry kiss of new lovers discovering each other's taste. No. This is the kiss that erases the boundary between bodies, the deep French kiss where tongues meet and tangle, where breath mingles until you cannot remember whose lungs the air came from, where you open your mouth so wide that your partner could crawl inside you if they wanted, if the laws of physics permitted such a thing. The wind is inside her mouth, down her throat, filling her lungs with each gasping breath. She is kissing the sky and the sky is kissing her back with a passion that borders on violence, that crosses into violence, that is violence disguised as intimacy or intimacy disguised as violence—she cannot tell the difference anymore and does not care to try.

She tumbles. She is tumbling. She will tumble through space until space runs out.

The world spins around her—sky, building, city, sky, building, city, sky—a carousel of light and darkness turning so fast that it blurs into a single smear of sensation. She does not try to stabilize herself, does not spread her limbs into a skydive position the way the people in videos do, the way she has been instructed to do. She lets herself cartwheel through space, head over heels, arms and legs trailing like ribbons. Each revolution brings a new perspective: the building's face rushing past in a streak of windows and concrete, the ground expanding below like a blooming flower, the sky wheeling overhead like a great dark carousel that spins forever, that will still be spinning long after she has hit the ground, after her body has been scraped from the pavement, after the city has forgotten that she was ever here.

The wind enters her.

Not metaphorically. She can feel it penetrating every opening—mouth, nose, ears—can feel it sliding between the lips of her vagina, probing at her anus with insistent pressure. She is being fucked by gravity itself, by the physics of descent, and she surrenders to it completely. Her clit throbs with each gust, each shift in air pressure. She is wet. She can feel it even in the screaming chaos of the fall, can feel moisture between her legs mixing with the sweat that the wind tears from her skin and carries upward in a fine mist. This is obscene. This is beautiful. This is honest. This is what being alive feels like when you are brave enough or desperate enough or broken enough to abandon all the careful insulation that stands between flesh and sensation, between the self and the truth of what the self actually is: meat hurtling through space, always falling, only occasionally interrupted by ground.

Forty stories remain.

The building's face is a blur, but she can feel the altitude in her body, can sense the distance remaining like an animal senses weather, like prey senses predator, like the dying sense death. Forty stories is time. Not much time. Perhaps six seconds. Perhaps eight. Humans fall at one hundred twenty miles per hour once terminal velocity is reached, and terminal velocity is reached quickly for naked bodies, for flesh without the drag of clothing to slow descent. Six seconds. Eight seconds. An eternity. An instant. Long enough to think a thousand thoughts. Not long enough to think a single one completely.

Thirty-five stories.

The building's face resolves into individual windows as she tumbles past. She can see inside them now—a man at a desk, his face lit blue by a computer screen, his eyes fixed on whatever work consumes his hours; an empty hallway with fluorescent lights humming their monotonous song; a woman standing at a window looking out, looking perhaps at her, though she is moving too fast to be sure, though she is spinning too wildly to focus. These glimpses of life flash past like images in a slideshow, each one appearing and disappearing in less than a heartbeat. These are the people who are not falling. Not yet. Not today. These are the people who have chosen to remain inside, to stay within the boundaries, to accept the walls and the ceilings and the floors that separate them from the void. She does not envy them. She pities them. But also she understands them. She was one of them once. Before she learned. Before she understood that the walls were not protection but prison, that safety was just another word for numbness, that the only way to feel anything real was to risk everything false. They are alive in the technical sense—their hearts beat, their lungs inflate, their cells divide—but they are not living. Not the way she is living in this moment. Not with this intensity. Not with this terrible clarity.

Thirty stories.

Her hair whips across her face, stinging her cheeks, getting into her mouth. She tastes salt—her own sweat, or perhaps tears, though she is not crying, has not cried in so long that she has forgotten what it feels like, has forgotten what sadness tastes like when it leaks from your eyes instead of sitting heavy in your chest like a stone. The wind has worked its way completely between her legs now, a constant pressure against her sex, and she grinds against it instinctively, her hips moving in small circles, chasing the sensation even as she plummets toward whatever waits below. Death or not-death. Ending or not-ending. She does not let herself think about the moment after, about what comes next, about whether there is a next. To think about it would break the spell, would ruin the perfection of this moment by contaminating it with future, with consequence, with the burden of aftermath.

Twenty-five stories.

The kiss deepens. The wind's tongue is everywhere, licking the hollow of her throat, the undersides of her breasts, the sensitive skin behind her knees. She opens her mouth wider and it fills her completely, choking her, sustaining her, becoming the only thing she needs. She does not need food or water or love or safety. She needs only this, this terrible intimacy with the void, this coupling with emptiness that feels more real than any human touch ever has. Her body is an instrument being played by the wind, every nerve a string that vibrates with sensation. She is music. She is screaming. She is alive.

She falls. She is falling. She has always been falling. She will fall until the falling stops, which is to say forever, which is to say now, which is to say in six seconds or five or four.

Twenty stories.

The details of the ground emerge now from the general blur. She can see the geometry of streets intersecting at right angles, the neat gridwork that humans impose on earth to make it legible, to make it property, to divide it into parcels that can be bought and sold and fought over. She can see the shapes of cars, small as toys from this height, crawling through the streets like beetles. She can see the rectangles of light that are doorways and windows, each one a portal into some private life, some story that is unfolding independent of her descent. She can see the crowd that has gathered, though they are still too far away to be more than dark smudges against the pavement.

They always gather.

Someone always sees you go over the edge and calls it in, and people come running with their phones held high, ready to capture death, ready to witness the moment when a body stops being a person and becomes a thing. They film it. They share it. They consume it. She is falling and they are watching and the watching is part of the fall, the consumption is part of the experience. 

Without witnesses, does the fall matter? Without cameras, does the death exist? 

She does not know. She knows only that they are there, that they will be there when she lands, that they will gather around her broken body and take photographs and upload them to networks where thousands of other eyes will consume her death, will watch her final moment on repeat, will witness her ending again and again until it becomes banal, until it becomes just another piece of content in the endless stream of content that pours through the world like sewage. They will consume her. They are already consuming her. She is being consumed even now, even in this moment, even as she falls. The consumption has already begun. The consumption never ends.

Fifteen stories.

Her breath comes in short, sharp gasps now. The wind is too strong, too fast, and her lungs cannot keep up with the demands of her racing heart. Her skin burns from the friction of air moving at terminal velocity—one hundred and twenty miles per hour, fast enough to strip away the outer layer of epidermis, fast enough to leave her raw and red and screaming as if she has been flayed, as if she is being flayed, as if the wind is a knife and she is being peeled like fruit, revealing the red wet truth beneath the civilized surface of skin. She can feel it happening, feel her skin abrading away molecule by molecule, and it hurts. God it hurts. But the hurt is good. The hurt reminds her that she is alive, that she has a body at all, that she exists as more than just consciousness floating in a void. Pain is clarity. Pain is truth. Pain is the body's way of insisting on its own reality in a world where reality has become negotiable, where memory and experience can be bought and sold, where nothing is certain except the physics of falling.

Ten stories.

The kiss becomes a bite. The wind's teeth sink into her flesh, into her breasts and belly and thighs, marking her, claiming her. She will be bruised tomorrow—if there is a tomorrow—covered in contusions the shape of air currents, and she will trace them with her fingers and try to remember this moment, this perfect moment of surrender, though already she knows the memory will be inadequate, will be a pale shadow of the lived experience, will be nothing compared to the reality of falling. Her girlfriend will see them and say nothing, will run her hands over the damaged skin with a gentleness that Simera can no longer feel, that registers as nothing more than pressure, as neutral as a breeze. Liz's touch used to mean something. Once. Before Simera learned what sensation could truly be. Before she discovered that the body is capable of so much more than the small safe pleasures that people settle for. Liz will say nothing but her eyes will ask the question they always ask: Why? Why do you do this? Why do you keep returning to the edge, to the fall, to the moment before death? And Simera will have no answer because the answer exists in the body, not the mind, and the body's language cannot be translated into words.

Seven stories.

She can see faces in the crowd now. Mouths open in expressions she can no longer read. Fear? Excitement? Arousal? It does not matter. They are watching her die and they are watching her come, and they cannot tell the difference because there is no difference, not here, not in this moment. Her orgasm builds in the base of her spine, radiating outward like a shock wave, tightening every muscle in her body until she is rigid, until she is a spear aimed at the earth, until she is nothing but trajectory, nothing but descent, nothing but flesh moving through space toward its inevitable conclusion.

Five stories.

The ground rushes up. The ground is rushing up. The ground has always been rushing up to meet her with the inevitability of mathematics, with the certainty of physics, with the cold indifference of matter obeying laws that were written before humans existed and will endure long after they are gone. Concrete and asphalt, hard and final and absolutely unforgiving. She can see the individual pebbles embedded in the pavement, can see the yellow paint of a parking space dividing line, can see the dark stain where someone spilled coffee or oil or blood. Every detail crystallizes with hyper-real clarity. Time does not slow—time is a human invention and has no power here—but her perception sharpens until she is seeing with a resolution beyond what her eyes should be capable of. She can see cracks in the concrete. She can see the texture of the asphalt. She can see her reflection in a puddle of water—a pale streak falling toward itself, two bodies racing to merge.

Three stories. Three stories. Three stories between her and the ground.

Her body convulses. The orgasm breaks over her like a wave, like the ground about to break her body, and she screams but the wind tears the sound away before it can escape her throat. Every nerve ending fires at once, sending signals of pleasure-pain-terror-ecstasy cascading through her nervous system faster than thought, faster than fear. She is coming and she is dying and she is more alive than she has ever been in the sad small rooms of her actual life, in the gray spaces where she works and sleeps and pretends to be a person with a future, with plans, with some reason to continue beyond simple momentum, beyond the biological imperative to keep breathing even when breathing has become just another form of work.

Two stories. Two stories. Only two stories left.

The crowd fills her vision now. She can see individual faces, can see the phones they hold, can see the lenses pointed at her like eyes, like weapons, like hungry mouths ready to consume her ending. She sees a woman in a red coat. She sees a man with a beard. She sees a child, too young to be seeing this, too young to understand what death is, but old enough to sense that something terrible and important is happening. Their faces blur. The whole world blurs. Everything narrows to a single point—the ground, the impact, the moment when she will stop.

One story. One story. One final story between flesh and pavement.

The ground fills her vision, fills the world, fills everything that has ever existed or will exist. The ground is all there is. The ground is truth. The ground is the answer to every question she has ever asked. She reaches out with her hands, though she knows it will not help, knows nothing can help now. Her fingers spread wide as if to catch herself, as if to embrace the pavement that will shatter every bone in her body. 

The kiss reaches its climax. 

The wind enters her completely, possesses her, and she opens herself wider, wider, offering everything she has to this final moment, this instant of absolute truth when the lie of her life will finally end, when the pretense of meaning will be stripped away and she will know—truly know—what it feels like to touch certainty, to reach the one thing that cannot be questioned or doubted or taken away, the one honest thing in a world of beautiful lies—
