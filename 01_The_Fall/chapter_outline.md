# Chapter 1: The Fall

## Chapter Summary
**Opening scene - In Medias Res**: Simera stands on the edge of a skyscraper in a hospital gown (and nothing else). She takes a breath and jumps into a free fall. This is a long, sensory, metaphor-rich descent—she strips naked as she falls, symbolizing absolute freedom. The fall is described through the metaphor of a passionate kiss, sensual and intense without explicit sexual vocabulary. The reader doesn't know yet that this is a Memento. The scene cuts just before impact, leaving the reader in suspense. Then Simera awakens in bed, pale and sweating, with Liz beside her toying with a small device she is preparing for a future scam, remarking on the intensity.

## Key Story Beats
- [ ] Simera on skyscraper edge in hospital gown
- [ ] The jump - beginning of the fall
- [ ] Stripping as metaphor for freedom
- [ ] Long, metaphorical description of fall (using kiss as metaphor)
- [ ] Building tension toward ground
- [ ] Cut at climax moment before impact
- [ ] Simera waking up in bed, disoriented
- [ ] Liz present, holding the device
- [ ] Reveal that it was a Memento

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Introduce her love for falling Mementos, her sensory seeking behavior
- **Liz**: First glimpse of her wit, her presence as observer/anchor

## Themes to Explore
- Freedom vs. confinement
- Reality vs. simulation
- The allure of extreme experiences
- Subtle hints at Simera's psychology

## Atmosphere & Tone
Prize-worthy opening. Devastatingly beautiful. Disorienting. Sensual without being explicit. A sense of falling into something inescapable. Literary and immersive - blend of Vehlmann's darkness, McCarthy's sparse brutality, Hugo's lyricism, and Saint-Exupéry's philosophical depth.

## Writing Notes
- Start strong - hook the reader immediately
- Immersive descriptions prioritizing beauty over speed
- Show Simera's OCD subtly (counting details during fall?)
- Use the kiss metaphor masterfully
- Build maximum tension before the cut
- Look into the stories considered the most arousing ever, understand how they work and try to replicate it here

## Your Notes & Ideas

### Initial Thoughts
The idea is good, i want to state again how important it will be that the metaphor is beautiful, it should make the reader feel something almost sexual. Simera could see the city as a living being, use smart metaphors for that. I'm thinking she could be counting the stories of the building as she falls, gradually as the chapter progresses, which would be great to bring tension to the reader.

### Key Scenes You Want to Include
when she is about to touch the ground, she sees her reflection on a puddle of water on the ground, the fall ends when she is about to kiss her own reflection, but she doesn't recognize the face she sees in the reflection (because it's not hers, it's the memento creator's face)

### Emotional Impact Goals
This chapter should make the reader feel like mementos do really feel good, the memento should actually make the reader feel aroused and good, they should also feel tense because they think Simera will die when reaching the ground
