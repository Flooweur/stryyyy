# Chapter 1: The Fall

## Chapter Summary
**Opening scene - In Medias Res**: Simera stands on the edge of a skyscraper in a hospital gown. She takes a breath and jumps into a free fall. This is a long, sensory, metaphor-rich descent—she gradually strips naked as she falls, symbolizing absolute freedom. The fall is described through the metaphor of a passionate kiss, sensual and intense without explicit sexual vocabulary. The reader doesn't know yet that this is a Memento. The scene cuts just before impact, leaving the reader in suspense. Then Simera awakens in bed, pale and sweating, with Liz beside her toying with the device, remarking on the intensity.

## Key Story Beats
- [ ] Simera on skyscraper edge in hospital gown
- [ ] The jump - beginning of the fall
- [ ] Progressive stripping as metaphor for freedom
- [ ] Long, metaphorical description of fall (using kiss as metaphor)
- [ ] Building tension toward ground
- [ ] Cut at climax moment before impact
- [ ] Simera waking up in bed, disoriented
- [ ] Liz present, holding the device
- [ ] Reveal that it was a Memento

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Introduce her love for falling Mementos, her sensory seeking behavior
- **Liz**: First glimpse of her wit, her presence as observer/anchor

## Themes to Explore
- Freedom vs. confinement
- Reality vs. simulation
- The allure of extreme experiences
- Subtle hints at Simera's psychology

## Atmosphere & Tone
Prize-worthy opening. Devastatingly beautiful. Disorienting. Sensual without being explicit. A sense of falling into something inescapable. Literary and immersive - blend of Vehlmann's darkness, McCarthy's sparse brutality, Hugo's lyricism, and Saint-Exupéry's philosophical depth.

## Writing Notes
- Start strong - hook the reader immediately
- Long, immersive descriptions prioritizing beauty over speed
- Show Simera's OCD subtly (counting details during fall?)
- Use the kiss metaphor masterfully
- Build maximum tension before the cut
