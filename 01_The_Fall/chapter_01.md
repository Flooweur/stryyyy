# Chapter 1: The Fall

The wind knows her name before she does.

Simera stands on the edge where the world ends—one hundred and fourteen stories above a city that breathes like a sleeping beast. The hospital gown clings to her body, thin as prayer, gossamer as last words. White fabric. Bloodless. Clean in a way nothing else is anymore, in a way nothing will ever be again.

Her toes curl over the lip of concrete. One hundred and fourteen. She counted them on the way up, each floor a heartbeat, each number a small stone dropped into the dark well of her chest where something vital used to live. The city sprawls below—all arteries and veins, all pulse and hunger. Light bleeds through its streets like luminescence through a dying fish. Buildings rise like ribs caging a heart that beats too slow. Streets wind like intestines digesting the lives fed into them. The beast dreams beneath its own skin, and she is about to wake it.

The sky is the color of old bruises, the kind that never quite heal.

She can see everything from here. The way the sodium lights bleed orange into the darkness like old copper in old veins. The way the buildings lean toward each other like drunks, like lovers, like people who have forgotten the difference. Somewhere down there, in one of those thousand lit windows, someone is eating dinner. Someone is fucking. Someone is dying. All of it happening at once, all of it meaningless as breath, as significant as her next heartbeat, which might be her last.

One hundred and fourteen floors. One hundred and fourteen chances to stop. One hundred and fourteen ways to choose to keep breathing. She didn't take any of them.

The gown lifts in the wind and she thinks of flags, of surrender, of white birds that have forgotten how to fly. Her arms spread. The fabric catches like a lover's hand catching your wrist. For a moment she is all wings, all surrender, all already falling before the fall even begins.

She takes a breath—

And steps into nothing.

---

The first second is pure betrayal. Her body doesn't understand what she's done. It claws for ground that isn't there, screams for safety that never was, reaches back toward a life already lost to gravity. The hospital gown billows up around her face, blinding her, smothering her, and she tears at it with desperate fingers. The fabric rips. The sound of it—that small violence, that intimate tearing—is lost immediately to the wind but she feels it in her palms, in her bones. The way the threads give up. The way surrender sounds when you can taste it on your tongue.

She pulls the gown over her head and lets it go. The white fabric tumbles upward—or she tumbles down—and for a heartbeat she watches it rise like a ghost, like everything she's leaving behind. Then it's gone, lost to the sky, and she is falling in her underwear, falling in her skin, falling toward the inevitable conclusion of gravity and bone.

One hundred and thirteen floors left. One hundred and twelve. She counts them as they blur past, these lit windows full of lives she'll never touch. In one of them, a woman stands at a stove. In another, a man watches a screen. They don't know she's falling. They don't know the air itself has teeth.

The wind is screaming. Or she is. Or the city is. Sound loses meaning when you're moving this fast, when the air becomes solid and then visceral and then cruel. It tears at her hair. Fills her mouth. She gulps it down like drowning, like the wind itself might save her if she can just swallow enough of it, if she can just become it.

One hundred and ten floors. One hundred and nine.

Her bra comes loose—she didn't mean to but her hands are clawing at everything, trying to hold onto something, even if that something is her own skin. The clasp gives. The fabric peels away. She watches it spiral off into darkness, a small bird with no wings, and then she is bare-chested, falling faster. Less resistance. Less mercy. The air takes what it wants.

This is when the kiss begins.

---

It starts soft. A brush of something against her lips—not lips but the memory of lips, not touch but the promise of touch, the way longing feels when it first wakes in your chest. The air moves across her mouth and it's gentle, almost questioning, like a first kiss from someone who isn't sure they're allowed. Like being asked a question in a language you've forgotten but your body still speaks. She opens her mouth to it. Opens everything. The wind rushes in, fills her, and she tastes altitude and electricity and the sharp mineral tang of rain that hasn't fallen yet, of blood that hasn't spilled yet.

One hundred and five. One hundred and four.

The kiss deepens. The wind presses harder now, more insistent, more needful. Her body arches into it without her permission. Her arms are still spread but they're not wings anymore. They're an offering. They're an acceptance. They're a plea. The air touches every part of her—her neck, her shoulders, the soft undersides of her arms where the skin is thinnest and the veins run closest to the surface. The hollow behind her knees. The small of her back where sweat pools. The curve of her hip. It's everywhere at once and she can't escape it and she doesn't want to and wanting has never felt so much like falling.

One hundred and one. One hundred.

Her underwear is gone—when did that happen?—and now she is entirely naked, entirely free, entirely falling toward an ending she can already feel in her teeth. The wind finds the curve of her spine and traces it like a tongue, slow and deliberate and knowing, and she gasps. The sound is ripped away immediately but she feels it in her throat, that small surrender, that tiny yes, that prayer she didn't know she was saying.

The city rises to meet her and it's beautiful in the way that death is beautiful when you stop fighting it. She can see the cracks in the concrete now. The stains on the buildings like old bloodstains. The graffiti like prayers scrawled by desperate hands. The way everything is broken when you get close enough. The way broken things are the only honest things left. Ninety-seven floors. Ninety-six. The windows are eyes now, watching her fall, witnessing her, and she wonders if they can see what she feels, if they understand that this is what flying looks like from the inside, this is what freedom costs when you can finally afford it.

The kiss becomes ravenous.

The wind slams into her and it's not gentle anymore. It's needful. It's desperate. It's hunger made manifest, desire made solid, want made flesh. It touches her everywhere—the hollow of her throat where her pulse hammers, the space between her breasts where her heart tries to escape, the soft give of her stomach where fear lives. Her thighs part without her meaning to, without her permission, and the air rushes between them, cold and insistent and utterly merciless and somehow exactly what she needs. She cries out. The sound is devoured before it can be born. The wind takes everything—her voice, her fear, her name.

Eighty-nine. Eighty-eight. Eighty-seven.

She's falling faster now, fast enough that the air itself becomes a kind of pressure, a kind of presence, a kind of lover that knows exactly how to touch her. It pins her arms back. It forces her legs apart. It holds her in an embrace that's half violence and half worship, and she can't tell the difference anymore. Can't tell where the wind ends and she begins. Can't tell if she's falling or being pulled, if this is death or ecstasy or the moment when they stop being different things.

The numbers blur. Seventy-three. Sixty-eight. Sixty-two.

The kiss is everywhere. It's in her hair, tangling it into knots that will never come undone. It's in her ears, screaming declarations she can't understand but feels in her marrow. It's across her back, down her legs, circling her ankles like hands that know exactly where to touch, exactly how much pressure breaks skin. Her body is alive in a way it's never been alive before, in a way it will never be alive again. Every nerve is singing. Every cell is awake and screaming. This is what it means to feel everything at once. This is what it means to be nothing but sensation. This is what it means to finally, finally be free of thought, of memory, of the grinding weight of being human.

Fifty-four. Forty-nine. Forty-three.

The ground is real now. Not just a promise but a certainty, not just a destination but an appointment she's going to keep. She can see the street, the cars like beetles, the people like ants. In thirty seconds she'll be one of them—spread across the pavement, red and broken and finally still. The thought should terrify her. It does terrify her. But terror and ecstasy have the same face when you're falling fast enough, and the kiss is building to something, rising toward a crescendo she can feel in her bones, in her blood, in the part of her that knows what endings taste like.

Thirty-two. Twenty-eight. Twenty-three.

The wind finds her mouth again and this time it's different. This time it's not gentle and it's not violent. It's just inevitable. It's the ending written in her bones, the conclusion her body has always been falling toward. It rushes down her throat, fills her lungs, and she's breathing it in, gulping it down, trying to hold onto it even as it tears through her like a prayer through a nonbeliever. Her eyes water. Her chest aches. She's never been this full. She's never been this empty. Both things are true at once, and truth has never felt so much like drowning.

Seventeen. Fourteen. Eleven.

Her body is tensing now, every muscle going tight, coiling like a spring, preparing for the moment when falling becomes landing, when flying becomes dying, when the kiss reaches its terrible conclusion. The kiss builds and builds and builds. The wind is a lover that knows exactly how to touch her, exactly where to press, exactly when to pull back and when to push forward and when to just hold on and never let go. She's shaking. She's screaming. She's completely lost to it, lost to herself, lost to everything except this moment, this sensation, this perfect terrible beautiful end.

Seven. Five. Three.

The street rushes up and she can see it now—a puddle of water, dark and still as a held breath, right where she's going to land. Right where she's going to end. Right where the kiss will consummate. Every part of her is alive and aching and screaming yes and no and please and more and stop and never stop and the air is inside her and around her and she is the air and the air is her and she can't tell anymore where one ends and the other begins, can't tell if she's being devoured or if she's the one doing the devouring.

Two floors. One.

She sees her reflection in the puddle—just for a heartbeat, just for a sliver of a second that stretches into eternity—and the face looking back at her is wrong. The eyes are darker, almost black. The cheekbones sharper, cutting angles she's never seen in a mirror. The mouth twisted into an expression she's never worn, something between ecstasy and terror and understanding. It's not her face. It's someone else's face. A stranger's face. A face that looks like it knows what dying tastes like and can't wait to taste it again.

A face that's falling toward water that will shatter on impact, that will break into a thousand glittering pieces, that will scatter like her thoughts, like her name, like everything she used to be before the wind taught her how to—

---

Simera wakes up gasping, drowning, dying.

The bed is soaked with sweat. Her heart is trying to break through her ribs, trying to escape her chest, trying to finish what the fall started. Her hands are clawing at the sheets, tangled in fabric that's too soft, too real, too present, too much like a shroud. For a moment she can't remember where she is. Can't remember who she is. Can't remember her own name or if she ever had one. Can't remember anything except the feeling of falling, the taste of wind like copper like blood like goodbye, the pressure of air against her skin like a kiss that never ended, never will end, never can end.

"Jesus, Sim."

The voice pulls her back. Grounds her. She turns her head—too fast, the room spins—and sees Liz sitting beside her on the bed. Liz's dark hair is messy, sleep-tangled. She's wearing an old t-shirt, three sizes too big. In her hands is the device: small, silver, no bigger than a cigarette case. The wire dangles loose, the end still warm from where it was plugged into the jack behind Simera's ear.

"That one must have been intense," Liz says. Her voice is dry, amused, but her eyes are worried. They're always worried these days.

Simera reaches up and touches the port behind her ear. The metal jack is still there, embedded in her skull, a small violation that stopped hurting years ago. Her fingers come away slick with the conductive gel they use. Clear. Odorless. It gets everywhere.

"Yeah," she manages. Her voice is rough. Scraped raw. "Yeah, it was."

Liz sets the device on the nightstand, next to the stack of bills they can't pay and the medication they can't afford. The device looks innocent there, nestled among all that failure like a viper in a nest of dead things. Just a small silver box. Just a way to live someone else's life for a little while. Just a way to die someone else's death and wake up still breathing. Just an escape from the grinding reality of being broke and desperate and slowly drowning in a world that doesn't give a shit if you drown, that profits from your drowning, that has learned to monetize even death itself, to make it safe and repeatable and addictive.

"The falling one again?" Liz asks.

Simera nods. She can still feel it—the phantom sensation of wind against her skin, the memory of that last moment before impact. Her body aches in places that weren't even touched. Her mouth is dry. Copper on her tongue. She counts the pills on the nightstand without meaning to: eight. Counts the bills: thirteen. Counts the number of breaths Liz takes before speaking again: four. The numbers calm her. The numbers always calm her.

"You really like those, huh?" Liz says. 

She's not judging. She never judges. That's one of the things Simera loves about her—maybe the main thing. Liz has her principles, sure. She won't touch Mementos herself, won't plug that wire into her own skull. But she doesn't judge Simera for it. Doesn't make it into a moral failing. Just accepts it as one more thing they navigate together, like the bills and the hunger and the slow erosion of hope. Like breathing. Like not breathing.

"I do," Simera says quietly.

Because it's true. She does love them. The falling ones most of all. That moment of pure surrender, pure freedom, pure sensation stripped of consequence. Nothing else comes close. Not sex, not drugs, not any of the cheap pleasures this world pretends will save you. Not even Liz's touch, though she'll never say that out loud. Just the fall. Just the wind. Just the certain knowledge that in a few seconds it will all be over, that the kiss will reach its conclusion, that you'll finally hit the ground.

Except you never hit the ground. That's the trick. That's the beautiful lie. That's the cruelty of it. You fall and fall and fall and then you wake up, safe in your bed, with someone you love looking at you like you're a problem they're trying to solve, like you're a wound they don't know how to close.

Liz reaches out and brushes the hair from Simera's face. Her touch is gentle. Real. Nothing like the wind. "You're shaking," she says.

"I'm okay."

"You're really not."

"I know."

Simera closes her eyes. Behind her eyelids she can still see it—that face in the puddle, the reflection that wasn't hers, the face of whoever jumped off that building and recorded their own death so people like her could pay to live it. Dark eyes that have seen the ground rushing up. Sharp cheekbones that have felt wind like a knife. A stranger's face that looks more familiar than her own. She wonders who they are. She wonders if they're still alive. She wonders if they did it more than once, if they're addicted to their own ending. She wonders if it matters. She wonders if anything matters when you've fallen that far and woken up still breathing.

"Sim," Liz says, and there's something in her voice now—a edge, a warning. "You know those things aren't real, right?"

"I know."

"You know they're just recordings. Someone else's memories."

"I know, Liz."

"You know that face you're seeing, those sensations you're feeling—they're not yours."

Simera opens her eyes. Looks at Liz. At her girlfriend, her anchor, the only thing keeping her tethered to this reality that feels less and less real every day. "I know," she says again.

But even as she says it, she's not sure she believes it. Because when she was falling, it felt real. More real than this bed, more real than Liz's worried eyes, more real than the bills they can't pay or the future they don't have or the love they're trying to keep alive in a world that starves it. It felt like the only true thing in a world made of lies and compromises and slow deaths that never quite finish. It felt like the only time she's ever been fully awake. 

And that terrifies her more than the fall ever did. Because if someone else's death feels more real than her own life, what does that make her? What does that make this? What does that make the woman in the kitchen making coffee, the woman who still believes in principles, who still believes there's a difference between falling and being pushed, between dying and living?

She doesn't know. She's not sure she wants to know.

Liz sighs and stands up. "I'm making coffee. You want some?"

"Yeah."

"Try not to die while I'm gone, okay?"

It's meant to be a joke but it lands wrong. Everything lands wrong these days. Simera watches Liz leave, watches her girlfriend's shoulders slumped under the weight of things they don't talk about, things they used to talk about, back when talking felt like something other than cataloging losses. Then she's alone in the room with the device on the nightstand, calling to her like a voice she can't ignore, like a memory she can't escape, like gravity.

She counts the walls: four. Counts the corners: four. Counts the cracks in the ceiling: twenty-three. Counts the number of breaths before she wants to fall again: she's already lost count. Counts the reasons to stay here, in this room, in this life, in this body that has never felt as alive as it did when it was dying: she can't get past one. Counts the seconds until she reaches for the device again: she's still counting, but the numbers are getting smaller.

Outside the window, the city breathes. Inside this room, Simera tries to remember how. Tries to remember why. Tries to remember if there was ever a time when breathing felt like something other than waiting to fall again.
