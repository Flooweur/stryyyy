# Chapter 1: The Fall

The wind finds her first.

It moves through the thin cotton of the hospital gown like it isn't there, like the fabric is just suggestion, just memory of clothing, just the ghost of modesty that she's already shed in her mind. The gown is white. Or was white. Now it's gray with city grime, stained with the accumulated filth of a building that's been standing for one hundred and fourteen years, that's been collecting dust and decay and the slow erosion of time measured in cracked windows and rusted steel and the weight of all the people who've lived and died within its walls.

One hundred and fourteen stories. She counts them. Has been counting them since she stepped onto the roof, since she walked to the edge, since she looked down and saw the city spread beneath her like a map of somewhere she's never been, like a promise of somewhere she'll never reach. One hundred and fourteen. The number sits in her chest like a stone, like a weight, like the only thing that's real in a world that's become liquid, unstable, a world where gravity is suggestion and falling is freedom and the ground is rushing up to meet her but hasn't reached her yet, hasn't claimed her yet, hasn't made her body into a statistic, into a headline, into the thing that happens to other people until it happens to you.

The wind finds her and she lets it. Opens her arms. Lets the gown billow around her like wings that don't work, like a parachute that won't open, like the last attempt at flight before the inevitable descent. The fabric catches air, fills with it, becomes something other than fabric—becomes resistance, becomes drag, becomes the only thing between her and terminal velocity, between her and the mathematics of falling bodies, between her and the moment when impact becomes impact, when falling becomes landing, when the body becomes meat.

But that moment hasn't come yet. That moment is still approaching, still building, still gathering speed and force and inevitability like a storm that's been building for one hundred and fourteen stories and is about to break, is about to release, is about to make contact with the earth in a way that will be final, absolute, irreversible.

She takes a breath.

One breath. The last one she'll take before she jumps, before she commits, before she steps off the edge and into the air and becomes something that's falling instead of something that's standing, something that's moving instead of something that's still, something that's free instead of something that's trapped.

The breath fills her lungs. She counts: one, two, three seconds of holding it, of containing it, of keeping the air inside her like a secret, like a promise, like the last thing she owns before she gives herself to gravity, before she surrenders to the fall, before she becomes the thing that happens when you step off a building and the ground is waiting and there's nothing between you and it except air and time and the mathematics of acceleration.

Then she jumps.

Not a leap. Not a dive. Just a step. A simple step forward, one foot in front of the other, the most basic human motion, the most fundamental act of movement, except this time the ground isn't there to catch her, isn't there to support her, isn't there to be the thing her foot lands on. This time the ground is one hundred and fourteen stories below, and between her and it is nothing except air and the promise of impact and the knowledge that falling is just another word for freedom when freedom means the absence of everything that held you, that trapped you, that kept you from becoming what you need to become.

Her foot finds nothing. Her body follows. Her weight shifts from supported to unsupported, from standing to falling, from still to motion, and the transition is immediate, total, absolute. There's no moment of hesitation, no moment of suspension, no moment where she's both falling and not falling. She's falling. The moment she steps off the edge, she's falling, and falling is what she is now, what she's become, what she'll be until the ground stops her, until impact becomes impact, until the body becomes something else entirely.

The wind rushes up to meet her. Or she rushes down to meet it. The distinction doesn't matter. What matters is the contact, the way the air moves against her skin, the way it presses against the hospital gown, the way it fills the fabric and makes it billow, makes it flutter, makes it move like something alive, like something that's trying to fly, like something that remembers what wings are supposed to do even though these aren't wings, aren't flight, are just the last attempt at resistance before surrender becomes complete.

One hundred and thirteen stories.

She counts them as she falls. Can't help it. The counting is automatic, involuntary, the one thing her brain insists on doing even when everything else has stopped making sense, even when the world has become a blur of motion and wind and the approaching ground, even when counting is the last thing that matters and also the only thing that matters because counting is control, is measurement, is the way she makes sense of chaos, the way she turns the overwhelming into discrete units that can be tracked, tallied, understood.

One hundred and thirteen. One hundred and twelve. One hundred and eleven.

The numbers arrive like footsteps, like heartbeats, like the rhythm of a song she's never heard but knows by heart, knows in her bones, knows in the part of her that counts everything because counting is the only way to hold onto reality when reality is falling apart, when the world is liquid, when everything solid becomes suggestion and the only thing that's real is the numbers, the measurements, the mathematics of descent.

The wind grows stronger. Or she's falling faster. Both, probably. Both are true. The faster she falls, the more the wind resists, the more it presses against her, the more it becomes a force instead of just air, becomes pressure instead of just space, becomes the thing that's trying to slow her down even though slowing down is impossible, even though acceleration is inevitable, even though the ground is approaching and nothing can stop it, nothing can change it, nothing can make the fall anything other than what it is: a body moving through space toward impact, toward contact, toward the moment when motion stops and stillness begins and the body becomes something else entirely.

The hospital gown catches more air. Billows more. Flutters more. Becomes less fabric and more resistance, less clothing and more drag, less a thing she's wearing and more a thing that's trying to hold her back, trying to slow her down, trying to be the parachute that won't open, the wings that don't work, the last attempt at flight before the fall becomes complete.

One hundred and ten. One hundred and nine. One hundred and eight.

She counts. The numbers keep coming. The stories keep passing. The building keeps rising beside her, a wall of glass and steel and concrete that's been standing for one hundred and fourteen years and will keep standing after she lands, after impact, after her body becomes a statistic and her fall becomes a headline and her death becomes something that happened to someone else, something that people read about and forget, something that's real for her but abstract for everyone else, something that matters only to the person who's experiencing it, who's living it, who's dying it.

The city spreads beneath her. She can see it now, see it clearly, see it in detail that wasn't visible from the roof, from the edge, from the place where she was still standing, still safe, still someone who could change her mind, could step back, could choose not to jump, not to fall, not to become the thing that happens when you step off a building and gravity takes over and the ground rushes up to meet you.

The city is alive. That's the first thing she notices. Not alive like a person is alive, but alive like an organism is alive, like a system is alive, like something that breathes and pulses and moves in ways that are too large to see from ground level, too vast to comprehend when you're inside it, but visible from here, from this height, from this perspective where the city becomes a pattern, becomes a rhythm, becomes a living thing that's been growing for centuries and will keep growing after she's gone, after her body is removed from the sidewalk, after her fall becomes memory, becomes story, becomes something that happened once and then didn't happen anymore.

The streets are veins. She can see them—the arterial roads, the smaller capillaries, the network of pathways that carry life through the city's body, that move people and cars and commerce through spaces that are both separate and connected, both individual and collective, both personal and systemic. The buildings are organs. She can see them too—the skyscrapers like lungs, the warehouses like stomachs, the residential blocks like hearts, each one serving a function, each one part of the larger organism, each one necessary for the city to live, to breathe, to exist as something more than just concrete and steel and glass arranged in patterns that look random but aren't, that look chaotic but are actually ordered, that look like accident but are actually design.

The city is breathing. She can feel it—not with her hands, not with her skin, but with something deeper, something that recognizes rhythm, that understands pulse, that knows what it means when something large and alive moves in ways that are too slow to see but too fast to ignore. The city breathes in: traffic flows, people move, commerce happens, life continues. The city breathes out: exhaust rises, heat escapes, energy dissipates, the day becomes night becomes day again in a cycle that's been repeating for centuries and will keep repeating after she's gone, after her body is removed, after her fall becomes just another moment in the city's long history of moments, just another breath in the city's long history of breathing.

One hundred and seven. One hundred and six. One hundred and five.

The numbers keep coming. The stories keep passing. The ground keeps approaching. The wind keeps pressing against her, keeps filling the hospital gown, keeps making it billow and flutter and move like something that's trying to fly, like something that remembers what flight is supposed to be even though this isn't flight, isn't flying, is just falling with style, just falling with resistance, just falling in a way that looks like it might be something else but isn't, can't be, won't be because falling is falling and the ground is waiting and impact is inevitable and nothing can change that, nothing can stop it, nothing can make the fall anything other than what it is.

The gown starts to tear.

She feels it first—a sudden release of pressure, a sudden shift in the way the fabric moves, the way it resists, the way it tries to hold her back. Then she sees it: a rip along the seam, a tear that starts small and grows, that begins as a single point of failure and expands into a line, into a gap, into an opening that lets the wind through, that lets the air escape, that lets the gown become less fabric and more suggestion, less clothing and more memory of clothing, less a thing she's wearing and more a thing that's coming apart, that's failing, that's surrendering to the forces that are tearing it, that are destroying it, that are making it into something that can't hold together anymore, can't maintain its shape anymore, can't be what it was anymore.

The tear widens. The fabric gives way. The gown starts to come apart, starts to separate, starts to become less a single piece of clothing and more fragments, more pieces, more things that used to be connected but aren't anymore, that used to be whole but are breaking, that used to hold together but are falling apart.

One hundred and four. One hundred and three. One hundred and two.

She counts. The numbers keep coming. The gown keeps tearing. The wind keeps pressing. The ground keeps approaching. Everything is happening at once, everything is moving, everything is changing, and the only thing that's constant is the counting, the numbers, the mathematics of descent that she can't stop, can't control, can't make anything other than what it is: a body falling through space, counting the stories as they pass, watching the gown come apart, feeling the wind press against her skin, knowing that impact is coming, that contact is inevitable, that the ground is waiting and nothing can stop it, nothing can change it, nothing can make the fall anything other than what it is.

The gown tears completely.

One moment it's there, billowing around her, trying to be wings, trying to be a parachute, trying to be something that slows her down, that resists the fall, that holds her back. The next moment it's gone—not gone gone, but gone from her, gone from her body, gone from the place where it was covering her, protecting her, keeping her skin from the wind, keeping her body from the air, keeping her from being completely exposed, completely naked, completely free in a way that's terrifying and beautiful and absolutely necessary because freedom means the absence of everything that held you, that trapped you, that kept you from becoming what you need to become.

The fabric tears away. Flutters behind her. Becomes something that's falling separately, that's moving through the air on its own, that's no longer connected to her body, no longer part of her, no longer the thing that was covering her, protecting her, keeping her from being completely exposed.

She's naked now.

Completely naked. Her skin exposed to the wind, to the air, to the city spread beneath her like a map of somewhere she's never been, like a promise of somewhere she'll never reach. Her body is visible now, completely visible, and there's something about that visibility that's terrifying and beautiful and absolutely necessary because being seen means being real, means existing in a way that can't be denied, can't be hidden, can't be anything other than what it is: a body falling through space, completely exposed, completely free, completely itself in a way that's never been possible before, that's never been allowed before, that's never been necessary before.

The wind presses against her skin. She feels it—not just the pressure, but the texture, the way the air moves across her body, the way it touches her, the way it makes contact with every part of her, every surface, every curve, every place where her body meets the world and the world meets her body and the boundary between them becomes fluid, becomes permeable, becomes something that can't be maintained, can't be held, can't be anything other than what it is: a body moving through air, completely exposed, completely free, completely itself.

One hundred and one. One hundred. Ninety-nine.

The numbers keep coming. The stories keep passing. The ground keeps approaching. The wind keeps pressing against her skin, keeps touching her, keeps making contact in ways that are intimate and overwhelming and absolutely necessary because contact means she's real, means she exists, means the fall is happening and she's experiencing it and nothing can change that, nothing can stop it, nothing can make the fall anything other than what it is.

The city spreads beneath her. She can see it more clearly now, see it in detail that wasn't visible before, see it as a living thing that's been growing for centuries and will keep growing after she's gone, after her body is removed, after her fall becomes memory, becomes story, becomes something that happened once and then didn't happen anymore.

The streets pulse with traffic. She can see it—the cars moving like blood cells, the people moving like nutrients, the whole system functioning, operating, living in ways that are too large to see from ground level, too vast to comprehend when you're inside it, but visible from here, from this height, from this perspective where the city becomes a pattern, becomes a rhythm, becomes a living thing that's been breathing for centuries and will keep breathing after she's gone, after her body is removed, after her fall becomes just another moment in the city's long history of moments, just another breath in the city's long history of breathing.

Ninety-eight. Ninety-seven. Ninety-six.

She counts. The numbers keep coming. The ground keeps approaching. The wind keeps pressing against her skin, keeps touching her, keeps making contact in ways that are becoming more intense, more urgent, more like something that's building toward a climax, toward a release, toward a moment when the pressure becomes too much, when the contact becomes too intense, when the fall becomes something that can't be sustained, that can't be maintained, that has to resolve, has to complete, has to become impact, has to become contact, has to become the thing that happens when a body moving through space meets the ground and motion stops and stillness begins and the body becomes something else entirely.

The wind is like a kiss now.

That's the only way to describe it. The way it presses against her, the way it touches her, the way it makes contact with every part of her body, every surface, every curve, every place where her skin meets the air and the air meets her skin and the boundary between them becomes fluid, becomes permeable, becomes something that can't be maintained, can't be held, can't be anything other than what it is.

The wind is like a kiss that starts soft, tentative, questioning. The way it first touches her skin—a whisper of contact, a suggestion of pressure, the gentlest recognition that she's there, that she's real, that she exists in a way that can be touched, that can be felt, that can be known through the way the air moves across her body and her body moves through the air.

Then the kiss deepens.

The wind presses harder. The contact becomes more intense. The way the air moves across her body becomes more urgent, more insistent, more like something that's building toward a climax, toward a release, toward a moment when the pressure becomes too much, when the contact becomes too intense, when the fall becomes something that can't be sustained, that can't be maintained, that has to resolve, has to complete.

The kiss becomes desperate now, urgent, insistent. The way the wind presses against her, the way it touches her, the way it makes contact with every part of her body becomes more like a demand, more like a need, more like something that's been building for one hundred and fourteen stories and is about to break, is about to release, is about to make contact in a way that will be final, absolute, irreversible.

The wind presses against her breasts, her stomach, her thighs, every surface of her body, every curve, every place where her skin is exposed and the air can touch it, can press against it, can make contact in ways that are intimate and overwhelming. The pressure builds. The contact intensifies. The way the air moves across her becomes more like a caress, more like a touch, more like something that's exploring her, learning her, knowing her through contact, through pressure, through the way her body responds to the air and the air responds to her body.

Her nipples harden against the pressure. Her skin flushes with sensation. Her body arches into the contact, into the touch, into the way the air moves across her, the way it presses against her, the way it makes her feel alive, feel real, feel like she exists in a way that can't be denied, can't be hidden, can't be anything other than what it is: a body falling through space, completely exposed, completely free, completely itself, and the air is touching her, is pressing against her, is making contact in ways that make her want to press back, to arch into it, to surrender to it, to let it know her completely, to let it touch every part of her, to let it make contact with every surface, every curve, every place where her body meets the world and the world meets her body and the boundary between them dissolves, becomes nothing, becomes everything, becomes the only thing that matters, the only thing that's real.

Ninety-five. Ninety-four. Ninety-three.

She counts. The numbers keep coming, faster now, more urgent, the ground approaching with increasing speed, the wind pressing harder, the contact becoming more intense, more overwhelming, more like something that's building toward a climax, toward a release, toward a moment when the pressure becomes too much, when the contact becomes too intense, when the fall becomes something that can't be sustained, that can't be maintained, that has to resolve, has to complete, has to become impact, has to become contact, has to become the thing that happens when a body moving through space meets the ground and motion stops and stillness begins and the body becomes something else entirely.

The counting accelerates. The numbers arrive faster. The stories pass quicker. The ground approaches with increasing urgency. The wind presses harder. The contact intensifies. Everything is building, everything is accelerating, everything is approaching the moment when it all resolves, when it all completes, when the fall becomes impact, when the approach becomes contact, when the body becomes something else entirely.

The city is closer now. She can see it in more detail, see the individual buildings, see the individual streets, see the individual people moving through spaces that are both separate and connected, both individual and collective, both personal and systemic. She can see the cars, the lights, the signs, the whole apparatus of urban life that's been functioning for centuries and will keep functioning after she's gone, after her body is removed, after her fall becomes just another moment in the city's long history of moments, just another breath in the city's long history of breathing.

The ground is closer now too. Much closer. She can see it—the concrete, the asphalt, the hard surfaces that are waiting for her, that are approaching, that are going to make contact with her body in a way that will be final, absolute, irreversible. She can see the details: the cracks in the sidewalk, the puddles from yesterday's rain, the small imperfections that make the ground real, that make it solid, that make it the thing that's going to stop her, that's going to end the fall, that's going to make the body become something else entirely.

Ninety-two. Ninety-one. Ninety.

The numbers keep coming. The ground keeps approaching. The wind keeps pressing against her skin, keeps touching her, keeps making contact in ways that are becoming more intense, more urgent, more like something that's building toward a climax, toward a release, toward a moment when the pressure becomes too much, when the contact becomes too intense, when the fall becomes something that can't be sustained, that can't be maintained, that has to resolve, has to complete, has to become impact, has to become contact, has to become the thing that happens when a body moving through space meets the ground and motion stops and stillness begins and the body becomes something else entirely.

The wind is like a kiss that's become desperate now, urgent, insistent. The way it presses against her, the way it touches her, the way it makes contact with every part of her body becomes more like a demand, more like a need, more like something that's been building for one hundred and fourteen stories and is about to break, is about to release, is about to make contact in a way that will be final, absolute, irreversible.

The ground is very close now. Very close. She can see it clearly, see every detail, see every crack, see every puddle, see every small imperfection that makes the ground real, that makes it solid, that makes it the thing that's going to stop her, that's going to end the fall, that's going to make the body become something else entirely.

There's a puddle. She can see it—a small pool of water left over from yesterday's rain, reflecting the sky, reflecting the buildings, reflecting the world that's been falling with her, that's been approaching with her, that's been getting closer and closer until now, until this moment, until she's close enough to see her own reflection in it, close enough to see her own face, close enough to see who she is, who she's been, who she's becoming.

She leans forward. Or the wind pushes her forward. Both, probably. Both are true. She leans into the fall, into the descent, into the approach toward the ground, toward the puddle, toward her own reflection that's waiting for her, that's showing her who she is, that's revealing the face that's been falling with her, that's been approaching with her, that's been getting closer and closer until now, until this moment, until she's close enough to touch it, close enough to kiss it, close enough to make contact with her own reflection, with her own face, with her own self that's been waiting for her, that's been approaching with her, that's been getting closer and closer until now, until this moment, until contact is inevitable, until the kiss is about to happen, until the fall is about to end and the body is about to become something else entirely.

She sees her face in the puddle.

Or not her face. Not exactly. The reflection shows a face, shows features, shows a person who's been falling, who's been approaching, who's been getting closer and closer until now, until this moment, until contact is about to happen, until the kiss is about to happen, until the fall is about to end.

But it's not her face. The features are different, the eyes are different, the whole structure of the face is different from what she remembers, from what she knows, from what she's been carrying with her.

The face in the puddle is someone else's face.

Dark eyes. Dark hair. Features that are familiar and unfamiliar at the same time, that she recognizes and doesn't recognize, that she knows and doesn't know.

The face in the puddle is the creator's face.

The person who recorded this. The person who experienced this. The person who jumped and fell and approached and saw and made contact and ended and became. The person whose experience this is, whose memory this is, whose fall this is, whose body this is, whose face this is.

The face in the puddle is not her face.

But she's about to kiss it anyway.

She leans forward. Or the wind pushes her forward. Both, probably. Both are true. She leans into the fall, into the descent, into the approach toward the ground, toward the puddle, toward the reflection that's not her reflection, toward the face that's not her face.

She's about to kiss it.

The reflection is close now. Very close. She can see every detail, see every feature, see every small imperfection that makes the face real, that makes it solid, that makes it the thing that's going to stop her, that's going to end the fall, that's going to make the body become something else entirely.

She's about to kiss it.

The lips are close now. Very close. She can see them clearly—the shape of them, the way they're parted slightly, the way they're waiting for her, approaching with her, about to make contact, about to receive the kiss, about to end the fall and begin something else entirely.

The ground is there. Right there. She can feel it—the heat rising from the concrete, the vibration of the city, the presence of something solid, something real, something that's going to stop her, that's going to end the fall, that's going to make contact in a way that will be final, absolute, irreversible.

She's about to kiss it.

Her lips part. The reflection's lips part. The distance between them collapses. The space becomes nothing. The fall becomes approach. The approach becomes contact. The contact becomes—

—

---

Simera opens her eyes.

The ceiling. Nine water stains. Twenty-six cracks. The familiar geography of her poverty, her prison, her life.

She counts them automatically. Nine. Twenty-six. The numbers arrive like footsteps, like heartbeats, like the rhythm of something she knows by heart, knows in her bones, knows in the part of her that counts everything because counting is the only way to hold onto reality when reality is falling apart.

But the fall ended.

Without the kiss. Without the contact. Without the impact. The fall ended because the Memento ended, because the recording stopped, because the experience was over and she was back here, back in her body, back in her bed, back in her life, back in the reality that's been waiting for her.

She's sweating. Her body is drenched in it, soaked through with the sweat that came from the fall, from the experience, from the Memento that felt real even though it wasn't, that was someone else's experience even though it was hers, that was someone else's body even though it was her body, that was someone else's face even though it was her face.

She's pale. She can feel it—the way her skin feels cold, the way her body feels drained, the way the experience has taken something from her, has extracted something, has made her into something different from what she was before, something that can't be named, can't be described, can only be felt, can only be experienced, can only be known through the way her body feels now, the way her mind feels now, the way everything feels now that the Memento is over and she's back in reality, back in her life, back in the poverty that's real, that's solid.

"Hey."

Liz's voice. Quiet. Careful. The voice she uses when she's trying not to startle, when she's trying not to intrude, when she's trying to be present without being overwhelming, when she's trying to be there without being too much, when she's trying to anchor Simera back to reality, back to her life, back to the poverty that's real, that's solid, that's the thing that's going to stop her, that's going to end her, that's going to make her body become something else entirely.

Simera turns her head. Liz is sitting on the edge of the mattress, holding a small device—a machine she's been working on, a scam she's been preparing, a thing that's supposed to extract value from systems that extract value from them, a thing that's supposed to help them survive, a thing that's supposed to make the math work, that's supposed to make the numbers add up, that's supposed to make poverty manageable, survivable, something they can endure instead of something that's going to kill them.

Liz is toying with it. Her fingers move over its surface, checking connections, testing mechanisms, making sure it works, making sure it's ready, making sure it can do what it's supposed to do, what it needs to do, what they need it to do if they're going to survive, if they're going to keep going, if they're going to make it through another day, another week, another month of poverty that's real, that's solid, that's the thing that's going to stop them, that's going to end them, that's going to make their bodies become something else entirely.

"That looked intense," Liz says. Her voice is quiet, careful, the voice she uses when she's trying not to startle, when she's trying to anchor Simera back to reality.

Simera doesn't answer. Can't answer. Doesn't know what to say, doesn't know how to describe what she experienced, what it felt like, what it meant, what it did to her, what it took from her, what it gave to her.

"You were counting," Liz says. "I could hear you. The numbers. The stories. One hundred and fourteen, one hundred and thirteen, one hundred and twelve. You were counting them as you fell."

Simera nods. Of course she was counting. She always counts. Can't help it. The counting is automatic, involuntary, the one thing her brain insists on doing even when everything else has stopped making sense.

"One hundred and fourteen stories," Simera says. Her voice is rough, thick with the residue of the experience.

"That's a long way to fall," Liz says. Her fingers keep moving over the device, checking connections, testing mechanisms.

"It felt longer," Simera says. "It felt like forever. It felt like the fall was the only thing that existed, the only thing that was real. Everything else was just suggestion, just memory, just possibility. The only thing that was real was the fall, was the wind, was the way the air touched my skin, was the way the city spread beneath me, was the way the ground approached, was the way the puddle reflected my face, was the way the reflection wasn't my face."

Liz stops toying with the device. Looks at Simera. Really looks. "You're pale. And sweaty. And your heart is racing. I can see it. The way your body is responding, the way it's trying to process what you just experienced."

Simera nods. The body doesn't know the difference between real and recorded, between actual and simulated, between experience and Memento. The body responds to what it experiences, to what it feels, regardless of whether it's real or recorded.

"That was intense," Simera says.

"Yeah," Liz says. "I could tell. The way you were breathing. The way you were moving."

Liz sets the device down. Moves closer. Puts her hand on Simera's shoulder. The touch is warm, real, immediate. Not recorded. Not simulated. Not Memento. Just touch. Just contact. Just the way one body meets another body and the boundary between them becomes fluid, becomes permeable.

"You're back now," Liz says. Her voice is gentle, careful. "You're here. You're with me. You're in your body. You're in your life."

Simera nods. Of course she's back. Of course she's here. Of course she's with Liz. Of course she's in her body, in her life, in the reality that's been waiting for her.

But part of her is still falling.

Part of her is still in the Memento, still experiencing the fall, still feeling the wind against her skin, still seeing the city spread beneath her, still approaching the ground, still seeing the puddle, still seeing the reflection, still seeing the face that's not her face, still about to kiss it, still about to make contact.

Part of her is still falling.

And she doesn't know if that part will ever land, will ever make contact, will ever end the fall and become something else entirely, or if it will just keep falling, just keep approaching, just keep getting closer and closer to the ground without ever reaching it.

She doesn't know.

And maybe that's the point. Maybe that's what Mementos do. Maybe that's what they're for. Maybe they're supposed to leave part of you falling, part of you approaching, part of you getting closer and closer to something without ever reaching it, without ever making contact, without ever ending the fall.

Simera closes her eyes. Counts: nine water stains, twenty-six cracks, one girlfriend, one touch, one moment of connection, one anchor back to reality.

One.

Always one.

The loneliest number. The most desperate number. The only number left when everything else has been counted, calculated, commodified, consumed.

The fall is over. The Memento is done. The experience is complete. She's back in reality, back in her life, back in the poverty that's real, that's solid.

But part of her is still falling.

And she doesn't know if that part will ever land.

She doesn't know.

And maybe that's the point.

Maybe that's what Mementos do.

Maybe that's why people use them.

Maybe that's what they're for.

Simera keeps her eyes closed. Counts her breaths. Counts Liz's breaths. Counts the seconds passing. Counts everything because counting is control, is measurement, is the way she makes sense of chaos, the way she turns the overwhelming into discrete units that can be tracked, tallied, understood.

She counts.

And part of her keeps falling.

And she doesn't know if that part will ever land.

The numbers never lie.

But sometimes they don't tell you everything.

Sometimes they only reveal their full meaning after you've already fallen, after you've already experienced, after you've already become what you've become.

Sometimes the numbers only reveal their full meaning after the fall is over, after the Memento is done, after the experience is complete, after you're back in reality, back in your life, back in the poverty that's real, that's solid.

Simera keeps counting.

And part of her keeps falling.

And she doesn't know if that part will ever land.

She doesn't know.

And maybe that's the point.
