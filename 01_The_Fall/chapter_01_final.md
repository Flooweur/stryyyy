# Chapter 1: The Fall

The city knows her name before she does.

It breathes beneath her—one hundred and fourteen stories down, a living thing made of steel and glass and the slow pulse of millions of lives happening simultaneously, each one a heartbeat in the vast organism that is this place, this time, this moment suspended between sky and ground, between being and unbeing, between the person she was and the person she's about to become.

Simera stands on the edge where the world ends.

The hospital gown clings to her body, white as bone, thin as the membrane between life and death. It flutters in the wind that rises from the city below, a wind that carries the scent of exhaust and rain and the distant promise of something ending. The fabric is translucent where it catches the light—sodium-vapor orange bleeding through from the streetlights far below, turning her into a ghost already, a specter preparing to cross over.

Her bare feet curl over the concrete lip. The edge is sharp, precise, a line drawn by architects who understood that boundaries are necessary, that limits exist for a reason, that some lines should never be crossed. But she's already crossed them. Already made the decision. Already chosen this.

One hundred and fourteen stories. She counted them on the way up, each floor a number, each number a heartbeat, each heartbeat a small death, a small surrender, a small stone dropped into the dark well of her chest where something vital used to live and now only echoes remain, only the memory of feeling, only the ghost of sensation.

The city sprawls below like a body laid out for autopsy. She can see its arteries—the streets winding through the grid, carrying traffic like blood cells, like life force, like the necessary circulation that keeps the whole thing alive. She can see its organs—the buildings rising like lungs, like hearts, like the necessary structures that process and filter and keep the system functioning. She can see its skin—the lights that pulse and flicker, that mark the presence of other lives, other people, other stories happening in parallel to hers, all of them unaware that she's standing here, that she's about to fall, that she's about to become part of the city's metabolism, digested and processed and made into something else entirely.

The sky above is the color of old bruises, the kind that never quite heal, that mark you permanently, that become part of your story whether you want them to or not. Clouds move slowly, indifferent, the way gods must be—unconcerned with the small dramas of individual lives, focused on larger patterns, on the slow grinding of time and weather and the inevitable entropy that claims everything eventually.

Somewhere in one of those thousand lit windows below, someone is eating dinner. Someone is making love. Someone is dying. Someone is being born. All of it happening at once, all of it meaningless and profound in equal measure, all of it part of the same vast machine that processes lives into statistics, into data, into the raw material of existence that gets consumed and discarded and replaced with new material, new lives, new stories that will also be consumed and discarded and replaced.

One hundred and fourteen floors. One hundred and fourteen chances to stop. One hundred and fourteen ways to choose to keep breathing, to keep existing, to keep being the person she was before she climbed these stairs, before she made this choice, before she decided that falling was better than staying, that surrender was better than fighting, that this moment of absolute freedom was worth whatever came after.

She didn't take any of them.

The gown lifts in the wind, billowing around her like wings, like surrender, like the white flag of a war she's already lost. Her arms spread. The fabric catches the air, fills with it, becomes something other than fabric—becomes possibility, becomes transformation, becomes the promise of what comes next. For a moment she is all wings, all surrender, all already falling before the fall even begins, already becoming something else, already crossing the boundary between who she is and who she's about to be.

She takes a breath—

The city breathes with her. Inhales. Exhales. A vast mechanical respiration that has been happening for decades, for centuries, that will continue happening long after she's gone, long after her body has been processed and digested and made into something the city can use, can consume, can transform into the raw material of its own continued existence.

She steps into nothing.

---

The first second is pure betrayal.

Her body doesn't understand what she's done. It claws for ground that isn't there, screams for safety that never was, reaches back toward a life already lost to gravity, already surrendered to the inevitable pull of the city below, which opens its mouth to receive her, which prepares to digest her, which waits with the patient hunger of something that has consumed millions before her and will consume millions after.

The hospital gown billows up around her face, blinding her, smothering her, wrapping her in white fabric that becomes a shroud, becomes a winding sheet, becomes the last thing she'll wear before the city takes her, before she becomes part of its metabolism, before she's processed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

She tears at it with desperate fingers. The fabric rips. The sound of it—that small violence, that intimate tearing—is lost immediately to the wind but she feels it in her palms, in her bones, in the deep animal part of her that knows what it means to struggle, to fight, to resist even when resistance is futile, even when the outcome is already determined.

The way the threads give up. The way surrender sounds when you can taste it on your tongue, when it becomes part of you, when it enters your bloodstream and changes your chemistry, when it rewrites your DNA and makes you into something that accepts falling as natural, as inevitable, as the only way forward.

She pulls the gown over her head and lets it go. The white fabric tumbles upward—or she tumbles down, perspective becomes fluid when you're falling, when gravity redefines everything, when the world rearranges itself around your descent—and for a heartbeat she watches it rise like a ghost, like everything she's leaving behind, like the person she was before she made this choice, before she stepped off the edge, before she became someone who falls, someone who surrenders, someone who chooses this.

Then it's gone, lost to the sky, and she is falling in her underwear, falling in her skin, falling toward the inevitable conclusion of gravity and bone and the city's patient hunger.

One hundred and thirteen floors left. One hundred and twelve.

She counts them as they blur past, these lit windows full of lives she'll never touch, full of stories she'll never know, full of people who are eating and sleeping and living and dying, all of them unaware that she's falling past them, that she's becoming part of the city's story, that she's being processed and transformed and made into something the city can use.

In one window, a woman stands at a stove, stirring something in a pot. Her movements are careful, deliberate, the movements of someone who has done this a thousand times, who will do it a thousand times more, who has found a rhythm in the repetition, a meaning in the mundane. She doesn't look up. Doesn't see Simera falling past. Doesn't know that someone is dying outside her window, that someone is choosing this, that someone has decided that falling is better than staying.

In another window, a man watches a screen. The blue light of it illuminates his face, makes him look like a ghost, like someone who has already crossed over, who exists in the space between reality and simulation, who has chosen the digital over the physical, the virtual over the real. He doesn't look up either. Doesn't see her. Doesn't know.

They don't know she's falling. They don't know the air itself has teeth. They don't know that the city is hungry, that it consumes lives the way a body consumes food, that it processes people into statistics, into data, into the raw material of its own continued existence.

One hundred and ten floors. One hundred and nine.

The wind is screaming. Or she is. Or the city is. Sound loses meaning when you're moving this fast, when the air becomes solid and then visceral and then cruel, when physics reasserts itself and reminds you that you're a body, that you're matter, that you're subject to the same laws that govern everything else, that there are no exceptions, no special cases, no way out of the mathematics of falling.

It tears at her hair. Fills her mouth. She gulps it down like drowning, like the wind itself might save her if she can just swallow enough of it, if she can just become it, if she can just transform herself into air and join the vast circulation of the atmosphere, become part of the city's respiration, be processed and transformed and made into something that can't fall, that can't die, that can't be consumed.

One hundred and eight. One hundred and seven.

Her bra comes loose—she didn't mean to but her hands are clawing at everything, trying to hold onto something, even if that something is her own skin, even if that something is the last barrier between her body and the air, between her and the city, between who she is and what she's becoming.

The clasp gives. The fabric peels away. She watches it spiral off into darkness, a small bird with no wings, a piece of her former self that the city has already claimed, that has already been processed, that has already been transformed into something else, into part of the vast metabolism that keeps the whole thing functioning.

Then she is bare-chested, falling faster. Less resistance. Less mercy. The air takes what it wants. The city takes what it wants. There are no boundaries anymore, no barriers, no way to protect herself from what's happening, from what she's becoming, from what the fall is making her into.

This is when the kiss begins.

---

It starts soft. A brush of something against her lips—not lips but the memory of lips, not touch but the promise of touch, the way longing feels when it first wakes in your chest, when it first makes itself known, when it first demands to be felt, to be acknowledged, to be given space in your consciousness.

The air moves across her mouth and it's gentle, almost questioning, like a first kiss from someone who isn't sure they're allowed, who isn't sure this is what you want, who is asking permission even as they're taking it, even as they're crossing boundaries, even as they're making you into something that wants this, that needs this, that can't imagine existing without it.

Like being asked a question in a language you've forgotten but your body still speaks, still remembers, still knows how to answer even when your mind doesn't, even when you can't find the words, even when language fails and only sensation remains, only the deep animal knowledge of what this means, of what it costs, of what it gives.

She opens her mouth to it. Opens everything. The wind rushes in, fills her, and she tastes altitude and electricity and the sharp mineral tang of rain that hasn't fallen yet, of blood that hasn't spilled yet, of the city's breath, which is exhaust and decay and the slow process of everything breaking down, of everything being consumed, of everything being transformed into something else.

One hundred and five. One hundred and four.

The kiss deepens. The wind presses harder now, more insistent, more needful, like a lover who has waited too long, who has been patient and can't be patient anymore, who needs this now, who needs you now, who needs to feel you, to taste you, to know you in the way that only falling allows, in the way that only surrender permits, in the way that only becomes possible when you've given up everything else, when you've become nothing but sensation, nothing but the moment, nothing but the kiss.

Her body arches into it without her permission. Her arms are still spread but they're not wings anymore. They're an offering. They're an acceptance. They're a plea. They're the gesture of someone who has given up, who has surrendered, who has decided that resistance is futile, that the only way forward is through, that the only way to survive this is to become it, to join it, to let it consume you and transform you and make you into something else entirely.

The air touches every part of her—her neck, her shoulders, the soft undersides of her arms where the skin is thinnest and the veins run closest to the surface, where her pulse is visible, where her life force is exposed, where the city can taste her, can sample her, can begin the process of consumption. The hollow behind her knees. The small of her back where sweat pools, where her body betrays her, where it shows that she's alive, that she's human, that she's matter that can be processed and transformed. The curve of her hip. The place where her body becomes something other than functional, where it becomes aesthetic, where it becomes something to be consumed, to be desired, to be made into part of the city's metabolism.

It's everywhere at once and she can't escape it and she doesn't want to and wanting has never felt so much like falling, so much like surrender, so much like becoming something other than what you were, something that exists only in relation to this, only as part of this, only as fuel for the vast machine that is the city, that is the fall, that is the kiss.

One hundred and one. One hundred.

The numbers are getting smaller. The ground is getting closer. The city is opening its mouth wider, preparing to receive her, to digest her, to process her and transform her and make her into something it can use, something that becomes part of its story, part of its metabolism, part of its continued existence.

Her underwear is gone—when did that happen?—and now she is entirely naked, entirely free, entirely falling toward an ending she can already feel in her teeth, in her bones, in the deep animal part of her that knows what this means, that understands the mathematics of falling, that has calculated the trajectory and knows exactly where she'll land, exactly when the kiss will reach its conclusion, exactly when the city will claim her, when it will consume her, when it will make her into something else entirely.

The wind finds the curve of her spine and traces it like a tongue, slow and deliberate and knowing, like someone who has memorized every inch of you, who knows the map of your body better than you do, who understands exactly where to press to make you arch, exactly where to linger to make you gasp, exactly how to touch you so that every nerve sings, so that every cell wakes, so that you become nothing but response, nothing but sensation, nothing but the perfect animal truth of what it means to be touched, to be known, to be consumed.

She gasps. The sound is ripped away immediately but she feels it in her throat, that small surrender, that tiny yes, that prayer she didn't know she was saying, that she didn't know her body was capable of, that she didn't know existed until this moment, until the wind touched her, until the city tasted her, until she understood that surrender is its own form of power, that giving up is its own kind of freedom, that becoming nothing is the only way to become everything.

Ninety-seven. Ninety-six. Ninety-five.

The city rises to meet her and it's beautiful in the way that death is beautiful when you stop fighting it, when you accept it, when you understand that this is natural, that this is inevitable, that this is part of the cycle, part of the process, part of the vast machine that processes lives into statistics, into data, into the raw material of existence.

She can see the cracks in the concrete now. The stains on the buildings like old bloodstains, like the marks of previous consumptions, previous transformations, previous lives that were processed and made into something else. The graffiti like prayers scrawled by desperate hands, by people who needed to leave a mark, who needed to be remembered, who needed to become part of the city's story in some way, even if it was just paint on a wall, even if it was just a name, even if it was just the desperate attempt to matter, to be seen, to be acknowledged before you're consumed, before you're processed, before you're made into something else entirely.

The way everything is broken when you get close enough. The way broken things are the only honest things left. The way the city shows its true face when you're falling toward it, when you're close enough to see the details, when you're about to become part of it, when it's about to consume you and transform you and make you into fuel for its own continued existence.

The windows are eyes now, watching her fall, witnessing her, and she wonders if they can see what she feels, if they understand that this is what flying looks like from the inside, this is what freedom costs when you can finally afford it, this is what it means to choose falling, to choose surrender, to choose becoming part of something larger, something that consumes and transforms and makes you into something else entirely.

Ninety-three. Ninety-two. Ninety-one.

The kiss becomes ravenous.

The wind slams into her and it's not gentle anymore. It's needful. It's desperate. It's hunger made manifest, desire made solid, want made flesh. It's the city's hunger, the city's need, the city's desire to consume her, to process her, to transform her and make her into part of its story, part of its metabolism, part of its continued existence.

It touches her everywhere—the hollow of her throat where her pulse hammers, where her life force is visible, where the city can taste her, can sample her, can begin the process of consumption. The space between her breasts where her heart tries to escape, where it beats against her ribs like a bird in a cage, like something that knows what's coming, that understands the mathematics of falling, that has calculated the trajectory and knows exactly when it will stop, exactly when the city will claim it, when it will be processed and transformed and made into something else entirely. The soft give of her stomach where fear lives, where it pools like water, where it becomes part of her, where it rewrites her chemistry and makes her into someone who needs this, who wants this, who can't imagine existing without it.

Her thighs part without her meaning to, without her permission, and the air rushes between them, cold and insistent and utterly merciless and somehow exactly what she needs, exactly what her body has been waiting for, exactly what will complete her, will finish her, will make her into something that no longer exists separately, that has merged with the fall, that has become the kiss, that has surrendered so completely to the moment that there is no distinction anymore between her and the air, between her and the city, between her and the vast hungry thing that is consuming her.

She cries out. The sound is devoured before it can be born. The wind takes everything—her voice, her fear, her name, her identity, everything that made her who she was before she stepped off the edge, before she made this choice, before she became someone who falls, someone who surrenders, someone who chooses this.

Eighty-nine. Eighty-eight. Eighty-seven.

She's falling faster now, fast enough that the air itself becomes a kind of pressure, a kind of presence, a kind of lover that knows exactly how to touch her, exactly where to press, exactly how much force to apply, exactly how to make her forget that there was ever a before, that there will ever be an after, that there is anything in the world except this moment, this sensation, this perfect terrible beautiful truth of what it means to fall, to surrender, to become.

It pins her arms back. It forces her legs apart. It holds her in an embrace that's half violence and half worship, and she can't tell the difference anymore. Can't tell where the wind ends and she begins. Can't tell if she's falling or being pulled, if this is death or ecstasy or the moment when they stop being different things, when they become the same thing, when the boundaries dissolve and you understand that you were never separate, that you were always part of this, that you were always meant to fall, always meant to surrender, always meant to become.

The numbers blur. Seventy-three. Sixty-eight. Sixty-two.

The kiss is everywhere. It's in her hair, tangling it into knots that will never come undone, that mark her as someone who has been touched, who has been claimed, who has been made into part of this, part of the fall, part of the city's story. It's in her ears, screaming declarations she can't understand but feels in her marrow, in her bones, in the deep animal part of her that knows what this means, that understands the mathematics of falling, that has calculated the trajectory and knows exactly where she'll land, exactly when the kiss will reach its conclusion, exactly when the city will claim her, when it will consume her, when it will make her into something else entirely.

It's across her back, down her legs, circling her ankles like hands that know exactly where to touch, exactly how much pressure breaks skin, exactly how to make her understand that this is what she was made for, that this is what her body was designed for, that every nerve, every cell, every atom of her existence has been waiting for this moment, has been preparing for this fall, has been yearning for this kiss.

Her body is alive in a way it's never been alive before, in a way it will never be alive again. Every nerve is singing. Every cell is awake and screaming. This is what it means to feel everything at once. This is what it means to be nothing but sensation. This is what it means to finally, finally be free of thought, of memory, of the grinding weight of being human, of the burden of identity, of the weight of being someone specific, someone defined, someone who exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories.

This is what it means to become pure sensation, pure experience, pure truth stripped of all the lies we tell ourselves to make existence bearable, all the stories we invent to give meaning to meaninglessness, all the ways we pretend that we matter, that we're separate, that we're anything other than matter falling through space, sensation without context, experience without consequence.

Fifty-four. Forty-nine. Forty-three.

The ground is real now. Not just a promise but a certainty, not just a destination but an appointment she's going to keep, a meeting with the city, with the pavement, with the moment when falling becomes landing, when flying becomes dying, when the kiss reaches its terrible conclusion and everything she is, everything she was, everything she might have been becomes nothing but impact, nothing but the final truth of what it means to fall, to surrender, to end.

She can see the street, the cars like beetles, the people like ants, all of them moving in patterns that make sense from this distance, that become part of the city's metabolism, part of its story, part of its continued existence. In thirty seconds she'll be one of them—spread across the pavement, red and broken and finally still, finally processed, finally transformed into something the city can use, can consume, can make into part of its own story.

The thought should terrify her. It does terrify her. But terror and ecstasy have the same face when you're falling fast enough, when you're close enough to the ground, when the kiss is building to something, rising toward a crescendo she can feel in her bones, in her blood, in the part of her that knows what endings taste like, that understands the mathematics of falling, that has calculated the trajectory and knows exactly where she'll land, exactly when the impact will come, exactly when everything will stop and nothing will remain except the truth of what she chose, what she became, what she surrendered to.

Thirty-two. Twenty-eight. Twenty-three.

The wind finds her mouth again and this time it's different. This time it's not gentle and it's not violent. It's just inevitable. It's the ending written in her bones, the conclusion her body has always been falling toward, the moment when the kiss becomes complete, when the fall becomes final, when everything she is becomes nothing but the truth of what it means to choose this, to want this, to need this so badly that nothing else matters, that nothing else exists, that nothing else can compare.

It rushes down her throat, fills her lungs, and she's breathing it in, gulping it down, trying to hold onto it even as it tears through her like a prayer through a nonbeliever, like hope through despair, like the last attempt to matter, to be seen, to be acknowledged before the impact comes, before everything stops, before the truth of what she chose becomes the only thing that remains.

Her eyes water. Her chest aches. She's never been this full. She's never been this empty. Both things are true at once, and truth has never felt so much like drowning, so much like falling, so much like becoming part of something larger, something that consumes and transforms and makes you into fuel for its own continued existence.

Seventeen. Fourteen. Eleven.

Her body is tensing now, every muscle going tight, coiling like a spring, preparing for the moment when falling becomes landing, when flying becomes dying, when the kiss reaches its terrible conclusion and everything she is, everything she was, everything she might have been becomes nothing but the impact, nothing but the truth, nothing but the final moment when choice becomes consequence, when desire becomes reality, when the fall becomes the end.

The kiss builds and builds and builds. The wind is a lover that knows exactly how to touch her, exactly where to press, exactly when to pull back and when to push forward and when to just hold on and never let go, when to make her understand that this is everything, that this is all there is, that this moment contains more truth than a lifetime of living, more sensation than a lifetime of feeling, more reality than a lifetime of existing.

She's shaking. She's screaming. She's completely lost to it, lost to herself, lost to everything except this moment, this sensation, this perfect terrible beautiful end, this moment when the kiss reaches its peak, when the fall reaches its conclusion, when everything she is becomes nothing but the truth of what it means to choose this, to want this, to need this so badly that nothing else matters, that nothing else exists, that nothing else can compare.

Seven. Five. Three.

The street rushes up and she can see it now—a puddle of water, dark and still as a held breath, right where she's going to land. Right where she's going to end. Right where the kiss will consummate, where the city will claim her, where it will consume her, where it will process her and transform her and make her into something else entirely.

Every part of her is alive and aching and screaming yes and no and please and more and stop and never stop and the air is inside her and around her and she is the air and the air is her and she can't tell anymore where one ends and the other begins, can't tell if she's being devoured or if she's the one doing the devouring, can't tell if she's falling or being pulled, if this is death or ecstasy or the moment when they stop being different things, when they become the same thing, when the boundaries dissolve and you understand that you were never separate, that you were always part of this, that you were always meant to fall, always meant to surrender, always meant to become nothing but sensation, nothing but truth, nothing but the perfect terrible beautiful reality of what it means to choose this, to want this, to need this.

Two floors. One.

She sees her reflection in the puddle—just for a heartbeat, just for a sliver of a second that stretches into eternity, that becomes the only thing that exists, the only truth, the only reality in a world that has become nothing but sensation, nothing but the fall, nothing but the kiss.

And the face looking back at her is wrong.

The eyes are darker, almost black, like someone who has seen the ground rushing up and chosen to look anyway, who has calculated the trajectory and knows exactly where they'll land, exactly when the city will claim them, exactly when they'll be consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

The cheekbones are sharper, cutting angles she's never seen in a mirror, angles that suggest someone who has done this before, who has fallen and been consumed and transformed and made into something else, someone who understands the mathematics of falling, who knows exactly what this costs, exactly what it gives, exactly how it feels to become part of something larger, something that consumes and transforms and makes you into fuel for its own continued existence.

The mouth is twisted into an expression she's never worn, something between ecstasy and terror and understanding, something that suggests someone who knows what dying tastes like and can't wait to taste it again, someone who has been here before, who has made this choice, who has become part of the city's story, part of its metabolism, part of its continued existence.

It's not her face. It's someone else's face. A stranger's face. A creator's face. A face that looks like it knows what falling feels like, what the kiss tastes like, what it means to be consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

A face that's falling toward water that will shatter on impact, that will break into a thousand glittering pieces, that will scatter like her thoughts, like her name, like everything she used to be before the wind taught her how to fall, before the city taught her how to surrender, before the kiss taught her how to become nothing but sensation, nothing but truth, nothing but the perfect terrible beautiful reality of what it means to choose this, to want this, to need this.

A face that's about to kiss its own reflection, about to meet itself in the water, about to become one with the image, about to complete the transformation, to finish the process, to understand that this is what she was always meant to become, that this is what she was always meant to choose, that this is the truth she was always falling toward, always surrendering to, always becoming.

Her lips part. The reflection's lips part. The distance closes. The water waits. The city opens its mouth. The kiss is about to reach its conclusion. The fall is about to end. The transformation is about to be complete.

She leans forward. The reflection leans forward. They're about to meet. They're about to become one. They're about to—

---

Simera wakes up gasping, drowning, dying.

The bed is soaked with sweat. Her heart is trying to break through her ribs, trying to escape her chest, trying to finish what the fall started, what the kiss promised, what the city almost claimed.

Her hands are clawing at the sheets, tangled in fabric that's too soft, too real, too present, too much like a shroud, too much like the hospital gown, too much like everything she was trying to escape, everything she was trying to become, everything the fall promised and the kiss delivered and the city almost consumed.

For a moment she can't remember where she is. Can't remember who she is. Can't remember her own name or if she ever had one, if she was ever someone specific, someone defined, someone who existed in relation to other things, other people, other stories.

Can't remember anything except the feeling of falling, the taste of wind like copper like blood like goodbye, the pressure of air against her skin like a kiss that never ended, never will end, never can end, that exists in her body now, that has rewritten her chemistry, that has made her into someone who needs this, who wants this, who can't imagine existing without it.

"Jesus, Sim."

The voice pulls her back. Grounds her. Makes her remember that she has a name, that she exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories, that she's not just sensation, not just experience, not just fuel for the vast machine that is the city, that is the fall, that is the kiss.

She turns her head—too fast, the room spins—and sees Liz sitting beside her on the bed. Liz's dark hair is messy, sleep-tangled. She's wearing an old t-shirt, three sizes too big, the fabric soft and worn and familiar in a way that makes Simera's chest ache, that makes her remember what it was like before, what it was like to be someone specific, someone defined, someone who existed in relation to other things, other people, other stories.

In her hands is the device: small, silver, no bigger than a cigarette case. The wire dangles loose, the end still warm from where it was plugged into the jack behind Simera's ear, still carrying the memory of the fall, the taste of the kiss, the sensation of being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

"That one must have been intense," Liz says. Her voice is dry, amused, but her eyes are worried. They're always worried these days. They've been worried for months, for as long as Simera has been falling, as long as she's been choosing this, as long as she's been becoming someone who needs this, who wants this, who can't imagine existing without it.

Simera reaches up and touches the port behind her ear. The metal jack is still there, embedded in her skull, a small violation that stopped hurting years ago, that became part of her, that marks her as someone who can be plugged in, who can be consumed, who can be transformed and made into something else entirely.

Her fingers come away slick with the conductive gel they use. Clear. Odorless. It gets everywhere. It marks her. It makes her into someone who has been here, who has done this, who has chosen falling over staying, surrender over fighting, becoming part of something larger over remaining someone specific, someone defined, someone who exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories.

"Yeah," she manages. Her voice is rough. Scraped raw. Like she's been screaming. Like she's been falling. Like she's been consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely. "Yeah, it was."

Liz sets the device on the nightstand, next to the stack of bills they can't pay and the medication they can't afford. The device looks innocent there, nestled among all that failure like a viper in a nest of dead things, like something that promises escape but delivers only the illusion of it, only the memory of falling, only the taste of the kiss, only the sensation of being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

Just a small silver box. Just a way to live someone else's life for a little while. Just a way to die someone else's death and wake up still breathing, still here, still someone specific, someone defined, someone who exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories.

Just an escape from the grinding reality of being broke and desperate and slowly drowning in a world that doesn't give a shit if you drown, that profits from your drowning, that has learned to monetize even death itself, to make it safe and repeatable and addictive, to turn falling into a product, to make the kiss into something you can buy, to transform the city's hunger into a market, into an economy, into a way to process lives into statistics, into data, into the raw material of existence.

"The falling one again?" Liz asks.

Simera nods. She can still feel it—the phantom sensation of wind against her skin, the memory of that last moment before impact, before the kiss reached its conclusion, before the city almost claimed her, almost consumed her, almost processed her and transformed her and made her into something else entirely.

Her body aches in places that weren't even touched. Her mouth is dry. Copper on her tongue. The taste of the kiss, the memory of falling, the sensation of being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

She counts the pills on the nightstand without meaning to: eight. Counts the bills: thirteen. Counts the number of breaths Liz takes before speaking again: four. The numbers calm her. The numbers always calm her. They make her into someone specific, someone defined, someone who exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories, someone who can count, who can measure, who can quantify the world and make it manageable, who can turn the overwhelming into discrete units that can be tracked, tallied, controlled.

"You really like those, huh?" Liz says.

She's not judging. She never judges. That's one of the things Simera loves about her—maybe the main thing. Liz has her principles, sure. She won't touch Mementos herself, won't plug that wire into her own skull, won't choose falling over staying, surrender over fighting, becoming part of something larger over remaining someone specific, someone defined, someone who exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories.

But she doesn't judge Simera for it. Doesn't make it into a moral failing. Just accepts it as one more thing they navigate together, like the bills and the hunger and the slow erosion of hope, like the way poverty grinds you down, like the way desperation makes you into someone who needs escape, who wants falling, who can't imagine existing without the kiss, without the sensation of being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

"I do," Simera says quietly.

Because it's true. She does love them. The falling ones most of all. That moment of pure surrender, pure freedom, pure sensation stripped of consequence. Nothing else comes close. Not sex, not drugs, not any of the cheap pleasures this world pretends will save you. Not even Liz's touch, though she'll never say that out loud, though she'll never admit that the kiss is better than love, that falling is better than staying, that being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely is better than remaining someone specific, someone defined, someone who exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories.

Just the fall. Just the wind. Just the certain knowledge that in a few seconds it will all be over, that the kiss will reach its conclusion, that you'll finally hit the ground, that the city will claim you, that it will consume you, that it will process you and transform you and make you into something else entirely.

Except you never hit the ground. That's the trick. That's the beautiful lie. That's the cruelty of it. You fall and fall and fall and then you wake up, safe in your bed, with someone you love looking at you like you're a problem they're trying to solve, like you're a wound they don't know how to close, like you're someone who has chosen falling over staying, surrender over fighting, becoming part of something larger over remaining someone specific, someone defined, someone who exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories.

Liz reaches out and brushes the hair from Simera's face. Her touch is gentle. Real. Nothing like the wind. Nothing like the kiss. Nothing like the sensation of being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

"You're shaking," she says.

"I'm okay."

"You're really not."

"I know."

Simera closes her eyes. Behind her eyelids she can still see it—that face in the puddle, the reflection that wasn't hers, the face of whoever jumped off that building and recorded their own death so people like her could pay to live it, so people like her could taste the kiss, could feel the fall, could experience the sensation of being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

Dark eyes that have seen the ground rushing up. Sharp cheekbones that have felt wind like a knife. A stranger's face that looks more familiar than her own, that suggests someone who has done this before, who has made this choice, who has become part of the city's story, part of its metabolism, part of its continued existence.

She wonders who they are. She wonders if they're still alive. She wonders if they did it more than once, if they're addicted to their own ending, if they've become someone who needs this, who wants this, who can't imagine existing without the fall, without the kiss, without the sensation of being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

She wonders if it matters. She wonders if anything matters when you've fallen that far and woken up still breathing, still here, still someone specific, someone defined, someone who exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories, someone who has tasted the kiss and can't forget it, someone who has felt the fall and needs it again, someone who has been consumed and transformed and made into something that needs to be consumed again, that needs to be transformed again, that needs to become part of something larger, something that processes lives into statistics, into data, into the raw material of existence.

"Sim," Liz says, and there's something in her voice now—an edge, a warning, like she knows what's happening, like she understands that Simera has been consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely, something that needs the fall, something that wants the kiss, something that can't imagine existing without it.

"You know those things aren't real, right?"

"I know."

"You know they're just recordings. Someone else's memories."

"I know, Liz."

"You know that face you're seeing, those sensations you're feeling—they're not yours."

Simera opens her eyes. Looks at Liz. At her girlfriend, her anchor, the only thing keeping her tethered to this reality that feels less and less real every day, that feels like a pale imitation of the fall, like a weak echo of the kiss, like something that can't compare to the sensation of being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

"I know," she says again.

But even as she says it, she's not sure she believes it. Because when she was falling, it felt real. More real than this bed, more real than Liz's worried eyes, more real than the bills they can't pay or the future they don't have or the love they're trying to keep alive in a world that starves it, that processes it, that transforms it into something else entirely.

It felt like the only true thing in a world made of lies and compromises and slow deaths that never quite finish, that never quite consume you, that never quite transform you, that never quite make you into something else entirely.

It felt like the only time she's ever been fully awake, fully alive, fully present in a way that this reality can't match, that this bed can't provide, that this love can't give her, no matter how much she wants it to, no matter how much she needs it to, no matter how much she wishes it could be enough.

And that terrifies her more than the fall ever did. Because if someone else's death feels more real than her own life, what does that make her? What does that make this? What does that make the woman sitting beside her, the woman who still believes in principles, who still believes there's a difference between falling and being pushed, between dying and living, between being consumed and remaining someone specific, someone defined, someone who exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories?

She doesn't know. She's not sure she wants to know. She's not sure she can know, not when the kiss still tastes like copper on her tongue, not when the fall still feels like the only real thing, not when being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely feels like the only way to be fully alive, fully present, fully awake.

Liz sighs and stands up. "I'm making coffee. You want some?"

"Yeah."

"Try not to die while I'm gone, okay?"

It's meant to be a joke but it lands wrong. Everything lands wrong these days. Simera watches Liz leave, watches her girlfriend's shoulders slumped under the weight of things they don't talk about, things they used to talk about, back when talking felt like something other than cataloging losses, back when love felt like enough, back when being someone specific, someone defined, someone who exists in relation to other things, other people, other stories felt like something that could sustain you, that could keep you alive, that could be enough.

Then she's alone in the room with the device on the nightstand, calling to her like a voice she can't ignore, like a memory she can't escape, like gravity, like the city's hunger, like the promise of the fall, like the taste of the kiss, like the sensation of being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

She counts the walls: four. Counts the corners: four. Counts the cracks in the ceiling: twenty-three. Counts the number of breaths before she wants to fall again: she's already lost count. Counts the reasons to stay here, in this room, in this life, in this body that has never felt as alive as it did when it was dying, when it was falling, when it was being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely: she can't get past one.

Counts the seconds until she reaches for the device again: she's still counting, but the numbers are getting smaller.

Outside the window, the city breathes. Inside this room, Simera tries to remember how. Tries to remember why. Tries to remember if there was ever a time when breathing felt like something other than waiting to fall again, waiting to taste the kiss again, waiting to be consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

The device sits on the nightstand. Small. Silver. Innocent. Just a way to escape. Just a way to fall. Just a way to taste the kiss, to feel the sensation of being consumed and transformed and made into something else entirely.

She's still counting. The numbers are getting smaller. The device is calling. The city is hungry. The fall is waiting. The kiss is ready.

She's still counting.

The numbers are getting smaller.
