CHAPTER 3: THE PRICE OF LIVING
================================

CHAPTER PITCH:
Simera works a dinner shift at Nouveau Terre, a gentrified restaurant where she serves expensive small plates to customers celebrating proposals and corporate dinners while earning barely enough to buy a single cheap Memento, and as she performs the empty theater of hospitality—smiling with a face that knows how to smile without consulting her brain, witnessing an anniversary couple's "happiest day" with complete emotional vacancy—she walks home through streets lined with the homeless and returns to find Liz mentioning a Heri Corporation advertisement offering five thousand units for a fall over forty stories, ten thousand without safety equipment, and fifty thousand for a real death, which plants the seed of a possibility that could save them from poverty or destroy Simera completely.

EXHAUSTIVE INSTRUCTIONS & IDEAS:

STRUCTURAL FUNCTION (Save the Cat! Beat Sheet):
- Continuation of SETUP / THESIS WORLD
- Establishes the WANT (external goal): Money, escape from poverty
- Introduces the CATALYST seeds (Heri buying Mementos)
- Shows Simera's external life (work) and its inadequacy
- Demonstrates the economic pressure driving the plot
- Final setup before the story breaks into new territory

WRITING STYLE DIRECTIVES:
- Maintain the muted, gray sensory palette of Chapter 2
- Use repetition to show the monotony of service work
- Deploy mechanical descriptions of labor (chopping, serving, cleaning)
- Contrast the performance of emotion with internal emptiness
- Use time markers to show the grinding length of the shift
- Dialogue should be functional, transactional (except with Liz)
- The walk home should be observational, documentary-style
- Final scene with Liz: intimate but tense

SCENE STRUCTURE:
1. ARRIVAL AT RESTAURANT (4pm): Description of space, start of prep
2. PREP WORK: Mechanical labor, Simera's wandering mind
3. PRE-SERVICE MEETING: Introduction to other workers, tonight's tables
4. SERVICE BEGINS (6pm): First customers, early evening rhythm
5. ANNIVERSARY COUPLE: The proposal scene (key emotional moment)
6. KITCHEN INTERLUDES: Brief moments with other workers
7. END OF SHIFT (11pm): Counting tips, changing clothes
8. WALK HOME: Through the city, past the homeless
9. RETURN TO APARTMENT: Liz asleep or pretending
10. LATE NIGHT CONVERSATION: The Heri advertisement revelation
11. REFLECTION: Simera unable to sleep, contemplating the numbers

ESSENTIAL DETAILS TO INCLUDE:

RESTAURANT DESCRIPTION:
- Name: Nouveau Terre (mispronounced by everyone)
- Former warehouse converted to "mixed-use retail space"
- Exposed brick, reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs (gentrification aesthetic)
- Small plates, deconstructed cuisine, expensive
- Black aprons with logo embroidered in white

COWORKERS:
- Mikel: Kitchen worker, intense, learned to cook in "prison or war"
- Marcus: Beautiful server who exploits it for tips
- Celine: Sociology student treating restaurant as field site
- Joel: 63 years old, zen acceptance of service work
- Sasha: 24-year-old manager, promoted because parents are investors

WORK DETAILS:
- Two hours of prep before service (onions, garlic, herbs)
- Mise en place as ritual
- 80 units for 6 hours plus tips
- Corporate dinner of eight (tasting menu)
- Anniversary couple at the window table (the proposal)
- The theater of "congratulations" with empty voice

ANNIVERSARY COUPLE SCENE:
- He touches his jacket pocket repeatedly (checking for ring)
- She is carefully dressed, makeup precise
- They order wine, white and red
- Small plates arranged like art
- Chocolate mousse in sugar cage for dessert
- He gets on one knee (expected, scripted)
- She says yes, people applaud, photos taken
- Champagne on the house (Sasha's instruction)
- "This is the happiest day of my life"
- Simera: "Congratulations. I'm so happy for you both." (empty sincerity)

SIMERA'S INTERNAL EXPERIENCE:
- "Her face knew how to smile without consulting her brain"
- Witnessing proposals as theater she's seen dozens of times
- Wondering what perfection feels like, if happiness has degrees
- "If the happiest day means all others are shadows"
- Crying over onions but not over her life
- Moving mechanically through familiar motions
- Already thinking about the Memento from earlier
- The memory fading like a painting in rain

OTHER WORKERS' MOMENTS:
- Marcus dealing with customer who says duck is overcooked
- Mikel: "It's perfect. They just don't know what duck looks like."
- Standing near dish station for warmth
- The rhythm of service: dining room to kitchen, performance to reality
- Brief camaraderie of shared degradation

WALK HOME:
- 11pm, streets mostly empty except homeless
- People sleeping in doorways, under overpasses
- The protocol: acknowledge no one, make eye contact with no one
- Proceed A to B as if human suffering doesn't exist
- Simera following the protocol, not looking
- Commentary on those who've "given up on participating in the economy"

APARTMENT RETURN:
- Dark apartment
- Liz asleep or pretending, back to door
- Simera undressing quietly
- The gap of space between them (inches to feet)
- Lying awake, unable to sleep
- Thinking about: the fall, the couple, happiness, meaning

THE HERI CONVERSATION:
- Simera at window, pressing hand against cold glass
- Liz wakes: "Can't sleep?" / "Thinking about it? The fall?"
- "What is it about falling?"
- Simera: "It's the only time I feel certain."
- "But you never hit the ground." / "No." / "So you never get the certainty."
- Liz went to the library, read Camus again (Sisyphus)
- "I saw something today. An advertisement on the metro. Heri is buying."
- THE PRICES: 5k for 40+ stories, 10k without safety, 50k for real death
- The numbers hanging in the air
- "Fifty thousand. That's more money than we'd make in two years."
- "Enough to move. Get somewhere with windows. Somewhere with heat."

KEY DIALOGUE:
- Liz: "I'm not suggesting you do it. I'm not suggesting anything."
- Simera: "But you are suggesting it. By telling me."
- Liz: "Is it more ethical to starve slowly or sell your death for enough money to live?"
- "There are other ways. Sex, maybe. Or drugs. Or violence short of murder."
- "Those pay less. A lot less. Sexual encounter maybe 500. Drug experience maybe 1000."
- Liz: "I don't want you to die. Even for fifty thousand. I'd rather be poor with you alive."
- Simera: "But you told me anyway."
- Liz: "Because I'm honest. Because you have a right to know your options."
- Simera: "I'm not going to kill myself. Not yet. But I am going to create Mementos."
- "Creating is different from consuming. When you create, it's your body. Your risk."

PHILOSOPHICAL CONTENT:
- Liz returning to The Myth of Sisyphus
- "We have to imagine Sisyphus happy"
- The boulder rolling down, the meaningless task repeated
- "Life is terrible and meaningless and we do it anyway"
- Liz: "Defiance is exhausting. Maybe Sisyphus isn't happy, just numb."
- "I say I love you but I'm watching you disappear"
- "Maybe I'm disappearing too, just in a different direction"

THEMATIC ELEMENTS:
- Labor as slow death vs. Mementos as fast death
- The commodification of experience (both restaurant and Memento work)
- Performance of emotion vs. genuine feeling
- Happiness as construct, as script people follow
- The privilege gap (customers vs. workers)
- Economic coercion (poverty forcing dangerous choices)
- The price of everything: meals, Mementos, lives, dignity

WORLD-BUILDING:
- Currency: "units" (establish this clearly)
- Heri Corporation actively recruiting creators
- Payment scale for different risk levels
- Bounties for specific experiences
- Legal market for safe Mementos
- Implied illegal market for real deaths
- Economic stratification (those who can afford meals vs. those serving them)
- Infrastructure: metro ads, libraries still exist, physical books

FORESHADOWING:
- "Once you start creating, it's hard to stop"
- "They'll want more. Heri always wants more."
- "The market demands escalation"
- "What's extreme today becomes boring tomorrow"
- "Until eventually the risk is too large and you don't come back"
- The 50k number planted firmly in reader's/Simera's mind
- "Tomorrow I'll go to Heri. See what they're buying."

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:
SIMERA:
- Show her complete disconnection from her work
- The automatic performance of service
- Her analysis of happiness as concept
- Thinking about the Memento even hours later
- Unable to sleep, obsessing
- The moment she decides to become a creator
- Drawn toward risk, toward feeling

LIZ:
- Her research habit (library, Camus)
- Struggling with ethical questions
- Wanting to protect Simera but being honest
- Her own exhaustion with meaning/meaninglessness
- The admission that she's disappearing too
- Loving but unable to save

SIMERA'S SHIFT:
- From consumer to potential creator
- From passive to active (somewhat)
- From victim of poverty to someone taking control (or losing it)
- The seed planted that will grow throughout the novel
- "I'll go tomorrow. To Heri."

ECONOMIC DETAILS:
- 80 units for 6 hours = roughly 13 units/hour
- Plus 37 units in tips = 117 total
- Enough to buy "a cheap Memento"
- Or save it toward rent, food
- Compare to: 5,000 units for one dangerous fall
- Or 50,000 for one death
- The math is impossible to ignore

SENSORY PALETTE:
- Sight: Restaurant's warm Edison lighting vs. cold fluorescent kitchen
- Sound: Clinking dishes, murmured dining room conversations, kitchen chaos
- Touch: Heat from stoves, cold outside, rough towel, Liz's warmth
- Smell: Onions, sulfur, food, mildew of apartment
- Taste: Nothing (Simera doesn't eat on-screen)

PACING:
- Long middle section showing work shift in detail (build monotony)
- Accelerate through walk home
- Slow down for the conversation with Liz
- End on contemplation (Simera awake, thinking)

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- 10-15 pages (longest chapter yet)
- The work section should feel long (make reader feel the shift)
- Use time markers (4pm, 6pm, 8:30pm, 11pm)
- Break into clear sections with white space
- End with the spider motif returning
- Close with Simera still falling (in her mind)

EMOTIONAL BEATS:
- Numbness (during work)
- Brief flicker of curiosity (proposal scene)
- Emptiness (performing congratulations)
- Disconnection (walk home, ignoring suffering)
- Restlessness (unable to sleep)
- Temptation (hearing the numbers)
- Decision (moment of commitment)
- Dread/excitement (mixed feelings about tomorrow)

KEY IMAGES:
- Simera chopping onions, tears that are chemical not emotional
- The anniversary couple's scripted happiness
- Marcus's beauty deployed as economic tool
- The homeless people as ghosts Simera walks past
- Liz at the library reading Camus
- The metro advertisement (described but not shown)
- Simera's hand pressed against cold window glass
- The spider's web, now complete, waiting

CONTRASTS:
- Expensive food vs. cheap labor
- Performance of joy vs. experience of emptiness
- Customers' excess vs. workers' poverty
- Consuming Mementos vs. creating them
- Slow poverty-death vs. fast fall-death
- Liz's philosophy vs. Simera's nihilism

QUESTIONS TO RAISE:
- Will Simera actually go to Heri?
- How far will she go?
- Can their relationship survive this?
- Is creation better or worse than consumption?
- What does "enough money" look like?
- Is Liz enabling or being honest?
- How much is a life worth?

AVOID:
- Making the work shift too short (need to feel the grind)
- Losing sympathy for Simera despite her numbness
- Making Liz the villain for mentioning the ad
- Romanticizing poverty or service work
- Heavy-handed critique (show, don't tell)
- Rushing to the Heri conversation
- Making the decision too easy

RELATIONSHIP TO PREVIOUS CHAPTERS:
- Chapter 1: The high (Memento experience)
- Chapter 2: The comedown (aftermath)
- Chapter 3: The reality (economic necessity)
- Progression from sensation to numbness to desperation
- Building pressure toward action
- Setup complete, catalyst approaching

CLOSING IMAGE:
- Return to the spider waiting
- Return to Simera falling (in dreams, in thoughts)
- "Tomorrow she would go to Heri"
- "But tonight she was still here"
- The sense of being on another edge, about to step off
- Leave reader knowing the story is about to accelerate

FINAL NOTE:
This chapter is about economic coercion dressed up as choice. Show how poverty doesn't just limit options—it creates impossible dilemmas. Make the reader understand why Simera will do what she's about to do. Not because she's suicidal, but because she's surviving. The tragedy is that these two things are about to become identical. End with the sense of inevitability: she's already falling, even before she goes to Heri.
