# Story Writing Instructions

## Style & Tone
- Deeply blend the styles of Fabien Vehlmann, Cormac McCarthy, Victor Hugo, and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry; use their strengths, but do **not** directly imitate or reference them. The story should stand alone as an original work.
- Write prize-worthy, emotionally devastating fiction.
- Chapters must be immersive, and vividly descriptive—prioritize beauty and depth over speed.

## Core Concept
- **Setting:** Dystopian world with the company "Heri," which sells recorded memories ("Mementos"). Users stream them to their brains via a device plugged behind the ear, experiencing memories as if truly living them.
- **Economy:** Dangerous or depraved Mementos yield higher rewards for creators and are valued by both Heri and black markets. There’s a stark divide between Memento "consumers" (users) and "creators" (who risk themselves for content).
- **Mechanics:** While using a Memento, people are unaware it’s artificial; device overwrites cognitive function.

## Main Characters
- **Simera**
  - Female protagonist, struggling financially with her girlfriend, Liz.
  - Performs small jobs and begins considering creating Mementos.
  - Subtle OCD: instinctively counts small details (chairs in a room, windows, etc.).
  - Preferences (show, don’t tell): Simera enjoys Mementos involving falling and sexual encounters specifically Asian women.
  - Increasingly nihilistic worldview as story progresses, demonstrated through actions and choices (not direct exposition).

- **Liz**
  - Simera’s girlfriend; witty, resourceful, lives with chronic stomach pain (requires strong painkillers occasionally), is pretty humorous when she feels good.
  - Principled: refuses to use Mementos, but does not judge Simera for doing so.
  - Scammer; skilled at rationalizing her actions.
  - Absurdist (show this in behaviour/dialogue, not in exposition).
  - Her presence anchors Simera, highlights the changing dynamic as Simera loses sensitivity/pleasure in life and their relationship.

## Key Story Beats & Structure
- **Opening (In Medias Res):**
  - Simera stands on a skyscraper edge, hospital gown fluttering, then jumps—falling and gradually stripping to nakedness as a symbol of freedom. The reader learns only after a long, sensory, metaphor-rich descent (using a passionate kiss as metaphor for the fall) that this is a Memento.
  - Cut at climax: just before impact. Simera awakens in bed, pale and sweating, Liz beside her.
  - Liz toys with a small device and wryly remarks on the intensity.
- **Progression:**
  - Simera, inspired by potential earnings and observing lavish creators, contemplates and enters the world of Memento creation, escalating to more extreme scenarios; may create illegal content for the black market.
  - "Show, don’t tell" Simera’s psyche through her choices in Mementos.
  - Black market for illegal, violent, or disturbing Mementos (murder, drugs, sex, etc.) is explored.
  - Some consumers dislike experiencing creator awareness; some creators use dissociatives before recording to enhance realism.
  - Characters’ choices must be psychologically believable and organic.
  - Implement ambiguous sequences where it’s unclear whether Simera is in real life or a Memento (heighten reader disorientation).
  - Explore themes: social/media pressure to create, parallels with exploitation in industries like pornography; show how rising earnings lure creators deeper.
  - Story should increasingly show Simera’s detachment—memories and reality blur (pace this carefully); build atmosphere of existential horror as reality/fragments slip.
  - Emphasize emotional impact: evoke dread, awe, heartbreak, and tears.

## Misc / Tips
- Use naturalistic dialogue and transitions; priorize dialogues so that the story feels alive; motivations must flow logically from character and circumstance.
- Avoid on-the-nose explanations; reveal core themes through scene and subtext.

## Ultimate Goal
- **Make the reader FEEL:** evoke dread, sorrow, catharsis—intensely and authentically.
