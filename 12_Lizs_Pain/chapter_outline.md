# Chapter 12: Liz's Pain

## Chapter Summary
Focus shifts to illuminate Liz's experience. Her chronic stomach pain worsens—maybe she's been neglecting it, or stress is making it worse. Her absurdist philosophy in the face of physical suffering. Her small scams continuing as her form of agency. Her watching Simera disappear into numbness. Her love persisting despite everything. Her attempts to maintain normalcy, to anchor them both. Her own fear about what's happening. A chapter that makes us see Liz fully—her wit as survival mechanism, her principles as anchor, her pain physical and emotional. Her choice to stay despite everything.
