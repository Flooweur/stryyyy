CHAPTER 4: HERI CORPORATION
============================

CHAPTER PITCH:
Simera takes the metro to Heri Corporation's headquarters—a gleaming tower that contrasts obscenely with the surrounding decay—where she passes through lobbies filled with advertisements for Mementos (skydiving, romance, violence, death) and meets with a recruitment specialist named Kael who explains the process with clinical detachment: creators undergo evaluation, choose their experiences, get fitted with recording equipment, and are paid based on intensity ratings, danger levels, and market demand, all while Simera realizes she is sitting in an office that processes human suffering as commodity and that she is about to become not a person but a product.

EXHAUSTIVE INSTRUCTIONS & IDEAS:

STRUCTURAL FUNCTION (Save the Cat! Beat Sheet):
- This is the CATALYST - the event that propels story forward
- Simera crosses threshold from consumer to creator
- Introduction of the industry's machinery and ethics
- Meeting the B-Story character variant (Kael as corporate face)
- Point of no return beginning
- External goal becomes tangible and real

WORLD-BUILDING PRIORITIES:
- Heri Corporation architecture and aesthetic
- The recruitment/evaluation process
- Recording technology and equipment
- Payment structures and intensity ratings
- Legal frameworks and waivers
- Other creators (glimpses of them)
- Market categories and demand
- The bureaucracy of commodified experience

SCENE STRUCTURE:
1. METRO RIDE: Journey through city, arrival at tower
2. LOBBY: First impressions, advertisements, other people
3. WAITING AREA: Simera observing, forms to fill out
4. KAEL'S OFFICE: The meeting, the explanation
5. EVALUATION DISCUSSION: What Simera can offer
6. VIEWING ROOM: Watching sample Mementos being made
7. CONTRACT MOMENT: The decision point
8. EXIT: Simera leaving, changed

KAEL CHARACTER:
- Mid-30s, professionally pleasant
- Treats death and sex with same clinical tone
- Not evil, just normalized to the work
- "I'm here to match creators with opportunities"
- Efficient, knowledgeable, slightly bored
- Has seen everything, shocks at nothing
- Represents the banality of evil

HERI BUILDING DESCRIPTION:
- Glass and steel tower, 60+ stories
- Lobbies with soaring ceilings, marble floors
- Screens everywhere showing Memento previews
- Categories: THRILL, INTIMACY, DARKNESS, TRANSCENDENCE, FINALE
- Clean, bright, expensive (contrast to Simera's world)
- Other people: some well-dressed (buyers), some nervous (potential creators)
- Security checkpoints, neural scanning
- The smell: antiseptic, new, nothing like poverty

DIALOGUE KEY MOMENTS:
- Kael: "You're already a consumer. That makes this easier."
- "The neural port means you understand the technology."
- "We're looking for authentic experiences. The market can tell the difference."
- "Falls are popular. High demand, especially from female creators."
- "Your consumption history shows a preference pattern. We can leverage that."
- "Safety equipment reduces payout but eliminates legal complications."
- Simera: "How much for a forty-story fall with equipment?"
- Kael: "Depends on your intensity rating. Baseline 3,500. Up to 6,000 for exceptional performance."
- "Performance?" 
- "Authenticity. Fear. Surrender. The market wants real emotion."

THE PROCESS EXPLAINED:
- Medical evaluation (heart rate variability, pain tolerance, fear response)
- Psychological screening (suicidal ideation vs. thrill-seeking)
- Recording equipment: enhanced neural connector, body sensors
- Experience selection from available "opportunities"
- Scheduling and logistics support
- Payment: half up front, half on successful delivery
- Quality control: Heri tests the Memento before release
- Creator anonymity maintained
- Waiver: extensive, legally binding, absolving Heri of responsibility

INTENSITY RATINGS:
- Measured by: heart rate, cortisol, adrenaline, neural activity
- Scale: 1-10
- Higher rating = higher payout
- Some creators use drugs to amplify response (illegal but common)
- Repeat creators build tolerance (need escalation)
- "Virgin creators" command premium (first-time authentic fear)

MARKET CATEGORIES:
- THRILL: Falls, extreme sports, dangerous stunts (what Simera wants)
- INTIMACY: Sex, romance, connection (high demand, lower pay)
- DARKNESS: Violence, drugs, taboo experiences (black market adjacent)
- TRANSCENDENCE: Spiritual, psychedelic, near-death (niche market)
- FINALE: Real death (illegal to advertise, underground market)

OTHER CREATORS GLIMPSED:
- Young man in waiting area, bruised and scarred (repeat creator)
- Woman leaving Kael's office, crying, clutching payment card
- Confident creator in expensive clothes (successful, been doing this)
- Group being fitted with recording equipment (about to create)

VIEWING ROOM SCENE:
- Kael shows Simera how it works
- They watch someone creating a Memento in real-time
- Maybe a car crash or fight or intimate moment
- Simera sees the person's terror/pleasure
- Monitors showing biometric data
- Technicians adjusting equipment
- The person is performing their trauma
- "This is a 7.2. Should sell well."

THE EVALUATION:
- Simera must undergo preliminary screening
- Heart rate test (they induce fear, measure response)
- Pain tolerance (brief electric shock)
- Psychological questions about death, meaning, fear
- Kael: "You score high on dissociation. That's good for falls."
- "Your baseline cortisol is elevated. Chronic stress. Also good."
- "You're an ideal candidate."

CONTRACT MOMENT:
- Pages and pages of legal text
- Simera skimming, not really reading
- "Sign here. Initial here. Here. Here."
- The moment of commitment
- Her hand signing her name
- Becoming official
- Payment card issued (for receiving funds)
- "Welcome to Heri. Your first opportunity is scheduled for Thursday."

THEMATIC ELEMENTS:
- Capitalism commodifying human experience
- The bureaucracy of suffering
- Clinical language masking horror
- "Opportunities" (euphemism for dangerous situations)
- The illusion of choice (poverty makes it coercion)
- Simera's agency questioned (is this freedom or desperation?)
- The normalization of exploitation

SIMERA'S INTERNAL EXPERIENCE:
- Initial awe at the building's wealth
- Disgust at the casual commodification
- Recognition of other creators (are they like her?)
- The medical tests feeling invasive
- Disconnect when signing contract (dissociation)
- Brief moment of doubt ("What am I doing?")
- Rationalization ("I need the money")
- Anticipation mixed with dread about Thursday

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Enhanced neural connector (more sophisticated than playback device)
- Body sensors: heart rate monitor, skin conductance, temperature
- Recording duration: experiences must be 20-60 minutes
- Data compression and packaging
- Quality metrics and market testing
- Distribution channels (how Mementos reach consumers)

FORESHADOWING:
- "Most creators start with safety equipment, then..."
- "We have a 98% safety rate. The 2% signed waivers."
- "Repeat creators tend to escalate. It's natural."
- "Your body builds tolerance. You'll need to push further."
- Reference to the underground market for Finale experiences
- Kael's subtle suggestion that Simera could do more

QUESTIONS RAISED:
- Will Simera actually go through with it?
- What is Thursday's "opportunity"?
- How will Liz react?
- Is Kael a villain or just a cog?
- What happens to the 2%?
- How far will this escalate?

EMOTIONAL BEATS:
- Curiosity (entering building)
- Discomfort (seeing commodification)
- Clinical detachment (during evaluation)
- Brief fear (during tests)
- Numbness (signing contract)
- Determination (committing to Thursday)
- Doubt (leaving building)

CLOSING IMAGE:
- Simera exiting into daylight
- The payment card in her pocket
- Looking up at the tower
- Feeling small
- "Thursday." 
- Return to gray streets
- The contrast between Heri's world and hers

AVOID:
- Making Kael cartoonishly evil
- Over-explaining the technology
- Losing Simera's perspective
- Rushing through the evaluation
- Making the decision too easy or too hard
- Preaching about capitalism
- Forgetting Simera's numbness

FINAL NOTE:
This chapter is about crossing a threshold. Simera enters as a consumer and leaves as a product. Show the machinery of exploitation without judgment—just the cold facts of how suffering becomes commodity. End with her committed but uncertain, having signed away something she can't quite name.
