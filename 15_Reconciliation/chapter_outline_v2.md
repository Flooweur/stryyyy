# Chapter 15: The Attempt - V2
## (Formerly "Reconciliation" - Significantly Revised)

## Chapter Summary
**MAJOR REVISION**: Simera can't watch anymore. Despite her own addiction, she has to try. She confronts Liz about her Memento use. The conversation is difficult—Simera struggling with her hypocrisy while trying to help Liz. Liz immediately throws it back: "You use too." It's true. But Simera persists—"You're worse than I am. You're disappearing." The confrontation is raw, honest, painful. **NEW: Instead of just making promises to quit, Simera suggests they attend a recovery support group together.** She found one in her research. Both of them will go. They'll face this together, with help. Liz agrees—she's scared, recognizes she's spiraling. **They attend a recovery group meeting.** Meeting other addicts, hearing recovery stories and relapse stories. The session is powerful—Simera and Liz as a couple in group, seeing they're not alone, that others have struggled. Initial hope emerges. The group facilitator is compassionate, knowledgeable. **This experience motivates Simera**: seeing the need for support, remembering her nursing background and desire to help, planting seeds for her to eventually start her own group. They leave feeling hopeful—fragile, but real. They make promises together: both will stop using, will attend weekly meetings, will help each other. Action is taken. Genuine hope exists. But the reader should sense: this is fragile. The addiction is powerful. The promises are sincere but...

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Confronting despite hypocrisy, admitting her own problem, desperate to help Liz but also herself, at the group: inspired by helping others, nursing instinct resurfacing, seeing path forward (supporting others in recovery), making sincere promises
- **Liz**: Defensive then broken, admitting addiction, wanting to stop but terrified, at the group: hearing others helps her feel less alone, less like a burden, recognizing her spiral isn't unique, making promises with Simera, hope mixed with fear

## World-Building Details
- **Recovery support groups**: Exist but underfunded, understaffed, not enough
- **Memento addiction**: Growing problem, insufficient infrastructure
- **Group therapy structure**: Sharing, education, coping strategies
- **Recovery is possible**: But difficult, requires ongoing support
- **Relapse common**: The facilitator and members are honest about this

## Themes to Explore
- The difficulty of helping when you need help yourself
- Mutual addiction, mutual recovery attempt
- Hope against odds
- Love as motivation for change
- Shared promises in desperation
- The belief that together you can succeed
- Community support as essential
- Fragility of good intentions
- Promises made before the real test
- Simera's core identity: helper, nurse, supporter

## Atmosphere & Tone
Raw, emotional, painful honesty. The confrontation difficult but necessary. The breakdown genuine—both scared, both wanting to stop. The support group: welcoming, non-judgmental, hopeful but realistic. The promises feel real. The hope is genuine but readers should sense fragility. Bittersweet—this is their best attempt, maybe last chance.

## Dialogue & Voice
- **Simera confronting**: "I see what this is doing to you. I can't watch anymore."
- **Liz's defense**: "You're one to talk. You use more than—" "No. You use more now. More than I ever did."
- **Liz's breakdown**: "I can't stop. I've tried. When I don't use, everything hurts—the pain, the guilt, the emptiness."
- **Group facilitator**: Compassionate, educational, "Addiction isn't moral failure. It's a response to unbearable circumstances."
- **Other members sharing**: Various stories, different stages of recovery
- **Simera and Liz sharing**: "We're both... we're using together. We want to stop. Together."
- **Promises**: "No more." / "We'll help each other." / "Weekly meetings." / "We can do this."

## The Confrontation - Detailed Scene

**Opening**:
- Simera: "Liz, we need to talk."
- Liz: (already defensive) "About?"
- Simera: "Your Memento use. Our Memento use."
- Liz: "Here we go."
- Simera: "No, listen. Please listen."

**The honest conversation**:
- Simera: "You asked to use 13 times yesterday."
- Liz: "You counted?"
- Simera: "I can't help counting. You know that. Thirteen times. You used 6 hours total."
- Liz: "So what? You use too."
- Simera: "I use maybe once or twice a day. You're using constantly. You can't stop."
- Liz: "And you can?"
- Simera: (pause) "I... no. Probably not. But you're worse. You're so much worse."
- Liz: "Thanks."
- Simera: "I don't mean— I mean you're in danger. I'm worried. I'm terrified."
- Liz: "Of what?"
- Simera: "That I'm going to lose you. That you're going to—" (can't finish)
- Liz: (defenses cracking) "Going to what? Die? Like Ed?"
- Simera: "Yes. Or just... disappear. You're already disappearing."
- Liz: "I'm right here."
- Simera: "Are you? Because the Liz I knew made jokes. Laughed. Noticed things. Cared about things."
- Simera: "The Liz I knew had opinions and wit and— Where is she? When did she go?"
- Liz: (breaking) "I don't know."

**The admission**:
- Liz: "I don't know when I stopped being me."
- Liz: "I just know that when I use, I don't have to think about it."
- Liz: "I don't have to think about anything."
- Liz: "The guilt stops. The pain stops. Everything stops."
- Liz: "And I know it's bad. I know I'm— I know."
- Liz: "But I can't stop. I've tried. I can't."
- Simera: "Then we'll stop together. We'll get help."

## The Support Group - Detailed Scene

**Arriving**:
- [ ] Community center, evening, fluorescent lights
- [ ] Following signs to basement room
- [ ] Door partially open, voices inside
- [ ] Simera and Liz hesitating: "We can still leave." / "No. We need this."
- [ ] Entering: Folding chairs in circle, coffee table, informational pamphlets
- [ ] 8 people already there, various ages, various stages

**The facilitator**:
- [ ] Name: Carmen (or your choice)
- [ ] Age: 40s, warm, professional but human
- [ ] Former Memento addict: 3 years clean
- [ ] Trained in addiction counseling (volunteer, not paid)
- [ ] Welcomes Simera and Liz: "First time? Welcome. You're safe here."

**The meeting structure**:
1. **Opening**: Facilitator welcomes, explains format
2. **Sharing circle**: Anyone can share, no pressure
3. **Educational segment**: Tonight's topic: "Understanding triggers"
4. **Coping strategies**: Practical tools for managing cravings
5. **Closing**: Reminder of next meeting, contact numbers for crisis

**Stories shared** (examples):
- Man in his 30s: 6 months clean, relapsed last week, trying again
- Woman in 20s: Using to cope with trauma, wants to stop, scared
- Teenager: Parents brought him, resistant at first, now attending voluntarily
- Older woman: Lost her husband to Memento-related accident, using to escape grief
- Each story resonates with Simera and Liz differently

**Simera and Liz's turn**:
- Facilitator: "Would either of you like to share?"
- Simera and Liz look at each other, Simera nods
- Liz: "We're... both using. Together. It started as—" (struggles)
- Simera: "I started creating Mementos for money. For survival. Then I started using."
- Simera: "Liz didn't use at first. She had principles. But then..."
- Liz: "Then I started. To cope with pain. Guilt. And now I can't stop."
- Liz: "We're here because... I think we're losing each other."
- Facilitator: "Thank you for sharing. That takes courage."
- Group: Supportive murmurs, nods of understanding

**Educational segment**:
- Facilitator explains: "Memento addiction is unique. It's not a substance—it's an experience."
- "But the brain responds similarly: dopamine, reward pathways, tolerance, withdrawal."
- "Psychological side effects specific to Mementos: dissociation, memory blur, identity fragmentation."
- "These can persist even after stopping use."
- "Recovery requires addressing both the addiction and the reasons you started using."
- **Simera listening intently**: Her nursing knowledge activating, understanding deeply
- **Recognition**: "I could teach this. I could help people understand."

**Simera's realization**:
- Watching facilitator: compassionate, knowledgeable, overworked
- Hearing about lack of resources: only one group, once a week, waitlists for therapy
- Seeing the need: 8 people here, hundreds more who need help, nowhere to go
- **Thinking**: "I researched how to start a group. I have nursing background. I understand addiction."
- "If I get clean—when I get clean—I could do this."
- "I could start another group. Help more people."
- Her core purpose resurfacing: helping people
- The nursing student who wanted to heal others
- This could be her path back to that person

**Leaving the meeting**:
- Exchanging contact info with some members
- Carmen giving them pamphlets, meeting schedule
- "Come back next week. And call if you need support before then."
- Walking to their apartment: holding hands, quiet
- Simera: "That helped." / Liz: "Yeah. It did."
- "We're not alone in this." / "No. We're not."

## The Promises - Night After Group

**In bed, not using for first night in weeks**:
- Simera: "We're really going to do this?"
- Liz: "Stop using?"
- Simera: "Stop using. Go to meetings. Actually recover."
- Liz: "I want to. God, I want to."
- Simera: "Me too."
- Liz: "But wanting and doing—"
- Simera: "We'll do it. Together. Like we said."
- **The promises**:
  - No more Mementos, starting now
  - Weekly group meetings, no missing
  - Call Carmen or each other during cravings
  - Find replacement activities (walks, reading, anything)
  - Be honest with each other about struggles
  - Take it one day at a time
- Liz: "I'm scared."
- Simera: "Me too."
- Simera: "But I think we can do this. I think we have to try."
- Liz: "What if we fail?"
- Simera: "Then we try again. That's what Carmen said. Relapse isn't failure. Stopping trying is failure."
- **Holding each other**: First real intimacy in chapters
- Feeling close, feeling hopeful, feeling like themselves
- Simera: "I love you."
- Liz: "I love you too."
- (First time either has said it in weeks)
- **Sleep without Mementos**: Difficult but together

## Key Improvements from Critique
- **Recovery group attendance** per user notes: They go together
- **Simera's path toward helping others**: Sees the need, recognizes she could do this
- **Nursing background resurfaces**: Her education and desire to help people returns
- **Support group motivation**: Will drive her to start her own (if she survives)
- **Not just promises**: Actual action taken, external support sought
- **Community shown**: Other addicts, facilitator, recovery culture
- **Hope is real**: Not false—genuine attempt, genuine support
- **Liz included**: They're doing this together, she's not excluded or judged
- **Education component**: Shows recovery requires understanding addiction
- **Fragility acknowledged**: Carmen and group honest about relapse being common

## Emotional Impact Goals
- Confrontation should feel painful but necessary
- Liz's breakdown should be heartbreaking—she wants to stop, can't alone
- Support group should feel welcoming and hopeful
- Hearing others' stories should create connection
- Simera's realization should feel like her true self emerging
- The promises should feel sincere and fragile
- Reader should feel hope—real, genuine hope
- But also dread—knowing how hard recovery is
- End with: maybe they'll make it, please let them make it

## Simera's Future Vision

**Brief moment of imagining**:
- During group, Simera imagining: "I could run a group like this."
- "Tuesday evenings. Free. Open to all."
- "Using my nursing knowledge, my understanding of Memento addiction."
- "Creating safe space for people like us."
- "Like I always wanted—helping people."
- Brief beautiful vision of recovery and purpose
- (Will this happen? Reader doesn't know, but the seed is planted)

---

## Notes for Execution
- The confrontation must feel raw and honest
- Support group must feel real—not idealized, not demonized
- Other members' stories add texture and reality
- Facilitator (Carmen) should be memorable, compassionate, knowledgeable
- Simera's realization about helping others is key character moment
- The promises must feel sincere (makes later failure hurt more)
- Hope is real here—this is their best chance
- But reader should sense: addiction is powerful, promises are hard to keep
- This chapter is the high point before final descent
- Makes Chapters 16-19 more tragic because they tried, really tried

**Status**: Ready for writing
