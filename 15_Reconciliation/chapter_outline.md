# Chapter 15: The Confrontation

## Chapter Summary
Simera can't watch anymore. Despite her own addiction, despite the hypocrisy, she has to try. She confronts Liz about her Memento use. The conversation is difficult—Simera struggling with her own addiction while trying to help Liz with hers. Liz immediately throws it back: "You use too. You're still using. How can you tell me to stop?" It's true. Simera knows it's true. But she persists—"I can see what it's doing to you. You're worse than I am. You're disappearing." The confrontation is raw, honest, painful. Simera admits her own problem, admits she should stop too, admits she doesn't know if she can. But she's terrified for Liz. Liz breaks down—admits she can't stop, admits she needs it, admits the guilt and pain are still there underneath, waiting whenever she's not using. They cry together. They make promises together—both of them will stop. They'll help each other. They'll quit together. The conversation ends with hope—tentative, fragile hope. They both mean it. They both want it. For a brief moment, it feels like recovery is possible, like love might be enough, like they might save each other. The chapter ends with them holding each other, both promising to stop, both believing it's possible. The reader should feel the hope but dread what's coming—the knowledge that promises made in desperation are hardest to keep.
