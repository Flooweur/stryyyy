# Chapter 15: Good Resolutions

## Chapter Summary
Simera can't watch anymore. Despite her own addiction, despite the hypocrisy, she has to try. She confronts Liz about her Memento use. The conversation is difficult—Simera struggling with her own addiction while trying to help Liz with hers. Liz immediately throws it back: "You use too. You're still using. How can you tell me to stop?" It's true. Simera knows it's true. But she persists—"I can see what it's doing to you. You're worse than I am. You're disappearing." The confrontation is raw, honest, painful. Simera admits her own problem, admits she should stop too, admits she doesn't know if she can. But she's terrified for Liz. Liz breaks down—admits she can't stop, admits she needs it, admits the guilt and pain are still there underneath, waiting whenever she's not using. They cry together. They make promises together—both of them will stop. Completely. No more Mementos. They'll find another way to survive. They'll get normal jobs. Real work. They'll help each other. They'll quit together. The decision feels monumental, necessary. They start immediately: both searching for work online, updating resumes, applying to positions. The activity feels productive, hopeful. Within days, Simera gets an interview—customer service, nothing glamorous, but legitimate work. The chapter ends with genuine hope. They're taking action. They're trying. They both mean it. Both believe it's possible. The reader should feel the hope but dread what's coming.

- Shared promises in desperation
- The belief that together you can succeed
- The fragility of good intentions
- Promises made before the real test

## Atmosphere & Tone
Raw, emotional, painful honesty. The confrontation difficult but necessary. The breakdown genuine. The hope real but fragile. The reader should feel moved by their love and promises, but dread the breaking of those promises. Bittersweet—this is the last moment of hope before the final descent.

## Writing Notes
- Make the confrontation feel real and difficult
- Simera's hypocrisy should be acknowledged
- Both characters' pain should be genuine
- The promises should feel real—they mean them
- Show their love for each other clearly
- This is their last chance, their last try
- The immediate action (job searching) should feel hopeful
- Show them working together on applications
- Simera's interview is a tangible sign of progress
- The hope should feel possible but doomed
- Reader knows what characters don't—promises in addiction are fragile
- This makes their attempt at normal life more tragic
- The contrast with later chapters will be devastating
- End on genuine hope and action that readers know won't last
