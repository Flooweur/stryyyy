# Chapter 15: The Damage Done

## Chapter Summary
Simera is trying to stay clean, keeping her promise. But the damage is already deep. She's more fragmented than she realized. Her memories are unstable—she has trouble distinguishing what's real, what was a Memento she created, what was one she consumed. Her OCD is worse. Reality feels thin, unreliable. She has moments where she doesn't recognize where she is, even though it's her own apartment. She looks at Liz and has to remind herself who she is. The cravings are constant, gnawing. Normal life feels unbearably empty. She's trying—genuinely trying—but she's realizing how far gone she already is. The psychological damage from months of recording and consuming is profound. She's more broken than either she or Liz understood. She's white-knuckling sobriety, but every moment feels like withdrawal. The fragmentation of self is already advanced.

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Damaged, trying, fragmented, recognizing how broken she is, fighting constant cravings
- **Liz**: Hopeful but seeing signs, trying to support, not fully aware of the extent

## Themes to Explore
- The lasting damage of addiction
- Psychological fragmentation
- Reality as unstable
- The difficulty of recovery when the self is already damaged
- Sobriety as constant struggle
- Self-awareness of damage
- The question of whether recovery is possible

## Atmosphere & Tone
Fragile, fragmented, effortful. The struggle to stay present. The constant pull of craving. The horror of recognizing yourself as broken. Tragic and tense. The reader should feel the impossibility of what Simera is trying to do.

## Writing Notes
- Show the ongoing damage even without new recordings
- Make the memory confusion real and frightening
- The cravings should be visceral
- Simera trying but the effort is enormous
- Reality feeling unreliable even in sobriety
- The reader should see this is unsustainable
- Elements from old Chapters 13 (The Blur), 14 (Ambiguous Reality), and 16 (The Disconnect) about fragmentation should inform this
- This sets up the inevitability of relapse
