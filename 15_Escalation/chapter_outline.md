# Chapter 15: Escalation

## Chapter Summary
Simera creating increasingly extreme black market content. Perhaps using dissociatives now to enhance the "realism" for consumers. Recording while partially unaware of what she's doing. The danger is real—physical harm, legal risk, psychological damage. Large payments but at devastating cost. She's barely herself anymore. Creating content that will haunt whoever consumes it, and her. The system feeding on her. Liz watching helplessly, or maybe Simera is hiding the extent of it. The descent accelerating.

## Key Story Beats
- [ ] Simera taking on extreme black market recordings
- [ ] Possible use of dissociatives before recording
- [ ] Recording while not fully aware/present
- [ ] Real physical danger and harm
- [ ] Large payments arriving
- [ ] The cost in psychological damage
- [ ] Liz discovering the extent (if she didn't know)
- [ ] The machine consuming Simera
- [ ] Loss of any remaining boundaries

## Character Focus
- **Simera**: Barely present, consumed by the work, damaged, nihilistic worldview fully realized
- **Liz**: Horror, helplessness, or anger if she discovers the extent

## Themes to Explore
- Complete commodification of self
- The exploitation machine fully visible
- Self-destruction as economic activity
- The point of no return long passed
- Systems that consume people

## Atmosphere & Tone
Dark, brutal, devastating. The full horror revealed. No romanticism left. The machine grinding bones. Tragic inevitability.

## Writing Notes
- Don't flinch from the darkness but don't be gratuitous
- The tragedy is the loss of self, not shock value
- Simera's absence from herself is the real horror
- Show the system that enables this
- Make it hurt
