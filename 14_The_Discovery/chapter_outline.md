# Chapter 14: The Asking

## Chapter Summary
The role reversal is complete. Liz is now the one asking Simera for Mementos. "Do you want to do one with me?" becomes a regular question. Sometimes it's Liz initiating, suggesting they use together. At first, Simera agrees, thinking it's still shared experience, still maintaining connection. But she begins to notice: Liz asks more often than Simera does. Liz chooses the more extreme content. Liz is the one who can't seem to go a day without suggesting it. The principled woman who refused to touch Mementos now needs them. Constantly. Simera has her own addiction, struggles with her own cravings, but watching Liz deteriorate is different—terrifying. Simera sees what she couldn't see in herself. Liz is fragmenting faster. Her OCD (if she has any manifestation) or her coping mechanisms are breaking down. Reality seems less solid for her. The absurdist humor that used to define her is gone, replaced by a desperate need for escape. Simera realizes with horror: Liz is worse off than she is. Liz is the addict now. The roles have completely reversed, and Simera doesn't know how to save someone from something she's still caught in herself.
